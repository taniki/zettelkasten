# The Rock, T.S. Eliot, 1934

> All our knowlege brings us near to our ignorance,
> All our ignorance brings us nearer to death,
> But nearness to death, no nearer to God.
> Where the the Life we have lost in living?
> Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?
> Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?
> The cycles of Heaven in twenty centuries
> Bring us farther from God and nearer to the Dust.
