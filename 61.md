# Paradigme psychomÃ©trique de la perception du risque

> Slovic contributed towards the **psychometric paradigm** of risk perception. He found that people usually perceived most activities as having a high risk. He also found that if someone gained pleasure from something they saw the risk level being low. This shows that risk levels can depend on the individual's personal belief and emotions of a specific risk.
