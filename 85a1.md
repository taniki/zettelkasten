# définition d'une décision

Contexte : decision intelligence

> Not all outputs/suggestions are decisions. In [decision analysis](http://bit.ly/decawiki) terminology, a decision is only _made_ once an _irrevocable_ allocation of resources takes place. As long as you can change your mind for free, no decision has been made yet.

## Decision maker

Dans ce contexte, le *decision maker* n'est pas celui qui valide ou demande la décision mais la personne à qui la décision appartient. Ce qui relève plus d'une notion d'ownership et de responsabilité plutôt que de hiérarchie.

> In our parlance, a “[_decision-maker_](http://bit.ly/quaesita_roles)” is not that stakeholder or investor who swoops in to veto the machinations of the project team, but rather the person who is responsible for [decision architecture](http://bit.ly/quaesita_dmguide) and [context framing](http://bit.ly/quaesita_default). In other words, a creator of meticulously-phrased objectives as opposed to their destroyer.

## data-inspired vs data-driven

> Many decision-makers think they’re being data-driven when they look at a number, form an opinion, and execute their decision. Unfortunately, such a decision will be “data-inspired” at best. Data-inspired decision-making is where we swim around in some numbers, eventually reach an emotional tipping point, and then decide. There were numbers near that decision somewhere, but those numbers didn’t drive the decision. The decision came from somewhere else entirely. It was there all along in the unconscious biases of the decision-maker.

## Default action

Action que l'on ferait en l'absence de données ou d'information. Permet de se prémunir des biais (de confirmation ou de l'effet Ikea par exemple)

> Choosing a default action is difficult for decision-makers who aren’t used to it. You ask yourself, “If I see no additional data beyond what I’ve already seen, what will I _do_?” Answering this takes strength of character  —  you can’t punt it to the data. You really have to think about the business problem and answer truthfully, “What am I going to pick if I have to make the decision right now?”
