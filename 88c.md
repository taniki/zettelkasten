# définitions de la causalité

[[@pearl2016]]

> A variable $X$ is a *cause* of a variable $Y$ if $Y$ in any way relies on $X$ for its values.
> p. 5

> A variable $X$ is a *direct cause* of a variable $Y$ if $X$ appears in the function that assigns $Y$'s value. $X$ is a *cause* of $Y$ if it is a direct cause of $Y$, or of any cause of $Y$.
> p. 26

> If, in a graphical model, a variable $X$ is the child of another variable $Y$, then $Y$ is a direct cause of $X$; if $X$ is a descendant of $Y$, then $Y$ is a potential cause of $X$.
> p. 27
