# causal effect rule

Given a graph $G$ in which a set of variables ${PA}$ are designated as the parents of $X$, the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ is given by :

$$
P(Y=y | do(X = x))) = \sum_{z} P(Y=y | X=x, \mathit{PA}=z) P(\mathit{PA}=z)
$$

[[@pearl2012]]

more convenient form :

$$
P(Y=y | do(X = x)))
=
\sum_{z} \frac{ P(X=x, Y=y, \mathit{PA}=z)}{P(X=x | \mathit{PA} = z)}
$$
