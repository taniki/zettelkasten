# backdoor criterion

## definition

> Given an ordered pair of variables $(X, Y)$ in a directed acyclic graph $G$, a set of variables $Z$ satisfies the *backdoor criterion* relative to $(X,Y)$ if no node in $Z$ is a descendant of $X$, and $Z$ blocks every path between $X$ and $Y$ that contains an arrow into $X$.
