# front door criterion

[[@pearl2016]] p.69

## definition

>A set of variables $Z$ is said to satisfy the front-door criterion relative to an ordered pair of variables $(X, Y)$ if 
> 1. $Z$ intercepts all directed paths from $X$ to $Y$.
> 2. There is a no unblocked path from $X$ to $Z$.
> 3. All backdoor paths from $Z$ to $Y$ a re blocked by $X$.

## front-door adjustment (theorem)

If $Z$ satisfies the front-door criterion relative to $(X,Y)$ and if $P(x,z) > 0$, then the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ is identifiable and is give by the formula

$$
P(y|do(x)) = \sum_{z} P(z|x) \sum_{x'} P(y|x',z) P(x')
$$
