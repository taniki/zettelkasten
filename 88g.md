# z-specific effect

The z-specific effect P(Y= y|do(X=x), Z=z) is identified whenever we can measure a set S of variables such that S U Z satisfies the backdoor criterion. Moreover, the z-specific effect is given by the following adjustment formula :

$$
P(Y=y | do(X=x), Z=z)
=
\sum_s P(Y=y|X=x, S=s, Z=z)P(S=s|Z=z)
$$
