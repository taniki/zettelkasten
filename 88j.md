# contrefactuel

En statistique une contrefactuelle est simplement une variable dont l'état n'est pas observé tel quel pour un individu donné. On peut alors changer l'état pour voir les effets.

> The key assumption of the model is that each individual in the population of interest has a potential outcome under each treatment state, even though each individual can be observed in only one treatment state at any point in time. For example, for the causal effect of having a college degree rather than only a high school diploma on subsequent earnings, adults who have completed only high school diplomas have theoretical what-if earnings under the state “have a college degree,” and adults who have completed college degrees have theoretical what-if earnings under the state “have only a high school diploma.” These what-if potential outcomes are counterfactual in the sense that they exist in theory but are not observed.
