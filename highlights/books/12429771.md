## Highlights
- Over time, however, we learned that society simply hadn’t worked out how to govern the new economy – how to direct its power and blunt its worst effects. ([Location 34](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=34))
- Disaster was averted because social reformers – people working out how to address the social implications of new technologies – ultimately succeeded. In the course of around 150 years, we upgraded how we govern the economy and society, steering the new form of capitalism in a more humane direction. ([Location 42](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=42))
- Eye-watering levels of inequality are back, but in new forms; the world’s twenty-two richest men now have more wealth than all the women in Africa.2 ([Location 65](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=65))
- There are fresh forms of consumer exploitation as companies use data to manipulate our behaviour in ways that weren’t conceived when the rules of regulation were written. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=69))
- Like the mess of Victorian Britain, the problems we’re experiencing aren’t signs of doom but of ungoverned potential. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=81))
- new governing mechanisms ([Location 82](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=82))
- I came to see that the digital revolution is about more than technology; it’s about the way we live and work with technology, and its social implications are barely beginning to be felt. ([Location 140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=140))

- To ride this new creature we’ll need new tools and techniques, and these won’t just be bigger or better versions of the ones we had before. We’ll need entirely new theories, institutions and policy mechanisms, just like we did last time. Some of these new ideas will feel scary and many will be unprecedented. But the prize – the potential if we can harness that creature for good – will be a society that’s richer, fairer and happier than ever before. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=154))
- does our economy, as it is currently governed, enable most people to live their life to the full? ([Location 159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=159))
- If markets – and the way we regulate markets – are broken, then the harm this causes in the long run will dwarf anything the state tries to do via redistribution or other remedial measures. So, ([Location 164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=164))
- How is the value generated by capitalism distributed in the internet age? ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=169))
- Are we working to live, or are we living to work? ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=175))

- Is democracy still functioning as a course-corrector, picking up on discontent about social problems and pushing political leaders to help solve them? And is the underlying machinery of the state even capable of solving the problems of a digital world? Are the state’s organisational structures, skills, culture and ways of working fit for the purpose of governing in the internet age? ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=179))
- Society didn’t survive the shift to industrialism by tweaking medieval policy instruments. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=187))
- I won’t tackle climate change directly, although the ideas in this book are consistent with a zero-carbon future – and indeed they should help, since it will be hard to achieve our ambitions on climate change if we don’t regain our grip on the core aspects of living standards. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=193))
- As many people learned to their dismay after 2008, a crisis does not always precipitate social change. ([Location 199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=199))
- The relationship between crisis and social change is, I’ve come to think, a bit like the relationship between a rainstorm and a mudslide. The rain doesn’t give the mudslide its power – that comes from the weight of earth, built up over decades. What the rain can do is loosen things up, creating the conditions for change. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=204))
- Yes, politics is a mess, but this doesn’t augur the end of the world – it just signals the end of a chapter in history. We’re living through a change – admittedly a dramatic and unnerving one – and the future beyond that change, if we can get there intact, has huge potential. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=215))
- The saving grace, as we’ll see throughout the book, is that hope is justified. History shows that we have agency at times like this, because the process of social change isn’t predestined, it’s a battle we’re all part of, and that we can all help to win.

- Child labour wasn’t banned after a cost-benefit analysis – it was banned because it was wrong. The welfare state wasn’t created because we counted the pennies in the jar and found we’d saved up enough to establish the NHS. We took a punt and built the future we wanted – and, by creating a more inclusive economy, that future then paid for itself.

- Over the last 150 years, the effort to steer capitalism to the first of these two outcomes became a fundamental role of the state. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=274))
- With each of these decisions, we embed these companies even further into our economy and our lives. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=321))
- A monopoly is a firm that dominates a market so fully that they break free from the constraints of competition. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=338))

- Luxottica, ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=354))
- The latest economic data suggests these firms represent something more than the old beast of monopoly easing free from its chains – it’s a whole new species on the loose. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=364))
- This is what economists call a composition effect; it’s not that all companies across the economy are changing, it’s that a new type of firm – typified by Google, Facebook, Tencent or Alibaba Group – is replacing an old type of firm. A world we knew how to govern is being replaced by one that we don’t – and that’s something we’ve seen happen in a different guise before. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=398))
- For all their inarguable value, however, the sheer power of railway companies – and the lack of choice this entailed for passengers – soon caused problems, and by the 1850s the situation was becoming unsustainable. Elites could now travel in luxury but ordinary working people had to plump for whatever the railway companies gave them and, for most, that meant the infamous experience of third-class travel. ([Location 421](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=421))
- By the end of the nineteenth century, anger at monopolies had wound America up into a fever. ([Location 454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=454))
- It mixed with frustration at a slew of social evils – from fetid living conditions to insecurity for workers – as a new and as-yet ungoverned form of capitalism spilled forth a sloppy mix of opportunities and risks. Eventually, under pressure, governments across industrial economies adopted a package of previously inconceivable social reforms, including efforts to limit monopoly power. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=463))
- Today, nearly a hundred countries have competition laws that prohibit cartels or block monopolistic mergers, from Japan’s 1947 Anti-monopoly Act, to Germany’s 1958 Law Against Restraints on Competition, to the UK’s 1965 Monopolies and Mergers Act. Having emerged from the historic fight against bigness, most of these laws still behave mechanistically; the Japanese competition authority, for example, is notified of a merger when the new business’s turnover exceeds twenty billion yen, while the UK Enterprise Act encourages the UK competition authority to investigate mergers among businesses with turnover exceeding seventy million pounds, or when the combined businesses would result in a market share of more than 25 per cent. It’s an approach that worked well when the size of a merger was a good indicator of its dangerousness but that, as we’ll see later, is increasingly outdated. ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=483))
- After the war, when the allies broke up German monopolies, the motivation was as much political as economic. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=506))
- Which all brings us back to today, as the descendants of those authorities look on with alarm as we enter a new chapter in this story. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=514))
- It’s not just the size of digital platforms that draws comparisons with the monopolies of the past; it’s their behaviours too. ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=522))
- Even when Google stays within the law, the sheer size of the company can cause unintended harm. One entrepreneur, who felt their website had ‘vanished’ after Google tweaked its all-powerful algorithm, said Google felt like an ‘Old Testament-style God. Nobody knows exactly what its will is; and if you displease it, there’s no telling how many sacrifices you need to make to get back in its good books.’43 ([Location 532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=532))
- Economic theory says that, in a competitive market, as companies jostle for position, profits should tend over time towards a company’s cost of capital – a figure that the CMA calculated at around 9 per cent for Google and Facebook. When they delved into the companies’ accounts, however, the CMA found that Google is making a return on capital of around 40 per cent while Facebook is making 38 per cent (that compares, for example, to 6 per cent for a company like Tesco or 6.5 per cent for BP). ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=568))
- Our traditional approach to competition policy seems at best ineffective at tackling these new giants, and at worst counterproductive or harmful. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=583))
- These transactions sailed through, at least in part, because of the outdated criteria by which mergers or acquisitions are typically blocked. In most countries these criteria still focus on the market share a company would gain by combining with the target firm, but in general companies like Google and Facebook don’t wait for their competitors to grow before they take them over; they eat them when they’re babies. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=612))
- The superstar dynamics that made them big in the first place – the power of data, the ability to hoover up small competitors, the network effects – would all still operate. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=630))
- if we want to harness the world’s technology giants for public good, we shouldn’t break them up – we should open them up. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=644))

- Yet lurking in the report on page seventy-four was a seemingly innocuous statement that had the potential fundamentally to change the way we govern digital markets. It reads: ‘in some markets, the key to effective competition may be to grant potential competitors access to privately-held data’.54 ([Location 656](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=656))
- And what if, instead of smashing that platform, we made it accessible to entrepreneurs, researchers and charities , treating it not like a private estate, but like an open frontier, so that more people could farm its abundant productive potential? ([Location 664](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=664))
- For instance, as an online store, Amazon would always have enjoyed some natural benefits of scale. But when Amazon became a platform for online stores, the company started to profit from world-conqueringly powerful network effects. This didn’t happen by accident; Amazon made choices to amplify these effects. They started by adding customer reviews to their website, so that the more customers they had, the more reviews they had, which attracted more customers. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=675))
- Data and networks help firms to create better products and services – or, rather, better ecosystems of products and services. But those same capabilities also make these ecosystems hard for competitors to dislodge. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=691))
- So what if we run with that brave idea, and try to open up the world’s biggest technology companies so that they benefit society as a whole? How could we do this in practice? ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=700))
- make the data accumulated by big technology platforms open, so that it is free for entrepreneurs, researchers and charities to use. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=702))
- This does not mean big tech should be stopped from using this data; it will, after all, also help the tech giants to keep improving their own brilliant products. But here’s the wonderful thing about data: sharing it doesn’t deplete it – it only generates more value. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=712))
- Big technology platforms have been known to share their data with other firms while keeping a close eye on the results, and then hoovering up any companies or innovations that emerge. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=716))
- The idea would be not to share specific tranches of data but rather to make all top-line data automatically available by default. An online space would be created in which the data was freely accessible. An institution – a sort of Public Data Trust – would safeguard the data, similar to the way the UK’s National Trust or the US National Park Service safeguards public land as a communal asset. In essence, the data would be reclassified from private to public; after all, it’s made up of our individual data, so surely in aggregate it’s ours too. ([Location 721](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=721))
- interoperability. ([Location 735](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=735))
- Running a digital infrastructure of global significance is nothing like running a normal business, and yet the law still treats it this way. ([Location 746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=746))
- What this new online world is missing is a digital equivalent to the rule of law. ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=752))
- To stop these behaviours we would need to recognise that globe-spanning digital platforms are not like other companies , and we would do this by assigning them a new legal status that comes with different rules and expectations. ([Location 755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=755))
- These changes would share the value of the digital era more widely across firms, people and places, rather than allowing this value to accumulate to a tiny elite. They would dilute those data and network effects, while not destroying the value that big tech creates, bringing their profits down from the stratosphere to more ordinary levels. ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=759))
- These services were ubiquitous for a reason – they were brilliant, improving her life in so many ways. Kashmir didn’t want those services to disappear, she just wanted to feel a little less locked in, a little less captive.

- We’ve let the kids into the sweet shop with no supervision, and now we’re getting angry at them for helping themselves. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=774))
- The boundary between the market and the state was calm, like an uncontentious border drawn long ago, its guard posts sleepy and overgrown after decades of peace. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=858))
- There’s nothing new about shaping consumer behaviour. For centuries, enterprising businesses have influenced their customers in a litany of subtle ways. ([Location 887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=887))
- As our lives as consumers move into digital environments, companies are gaining a god-like control over the context in which we make choices. Using the vast quantities of data we generate when we interact with online services, companies can also test and refine ways to manipulate our choices – adding an anxiety-inducing countdown clock here, or a tempting free trial there, and monitoring with scientific precision how we react. As these techniques prove profitable, they’re feeding a whole new industry of professionals, consultancies and start-ups that help companies to optimise our behaviour for profit. ([Location 894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=894))

- As big data spreads deeper into the economy, beyond vanguard sectors like software, these techniques are spreading too. Take the last time you collected a hire car at an airport; it’s a safe bet that you turned up only to find out that something hadn’t been included in the price you were quoted online. Perhaps there was a mileage limit, or the insurance was inadequate, leaving you exposed to eye-watering excess fees and inexplicably large potential bills for damage repairs. This is a choice architecture play: once you’re at the airport, you’ve got little option but to pay the extra money. Have you chosen to pay that amount? Sort of. But it feels like a hold-up – a choice in only the narrowest sense of the word. ‘Your money or your life’. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=912))
- This magical alignment – between a company’s interests and their customer’s interests – is part of what gave post-war twentieth-century capitalism its golden glow. It meant the surest route to profit was to keep us happy – to make a product or service that is better than the others. It’s what made that approach to regulation – in which governments stood back, watching like a proud parent and intervening only by exception – all OK. And it’s what helped to make that big idea, consumer choice, a potent ally with democratic choice, as images of Big Macs and Levi’s helped to decide the Cold War in favour of the Western economic and social model. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=920))
- Business after business chased down ever more ingenious routes to profit, first improving their products and then branching off to create entirely new innovations. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=927))
- A world of dark nudges could look very different to this. It sees the ingenuity and effort of competition going not into the product itself, but into smart ways to manipulate our choices. ([Location 931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=931))
- What Mohammed was experiencing is a practice known as price discrimination, and it goes far beyond car insurance. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=949))
- As computing capabilities have grown, the systems companies use to make pricing and lending decisions have become increasingly sophisticated. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=957))
- Other companies – often nervous about the reputational risks of variable prices – achieve a similar outcome with an approach called search discrimination; it means two customers are shown different results despite typing the same words into the search box, guiding them to products at different price points. ([Location 959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=959))
- Today’s prices are optimised live, moving over time and in umpteen other dimensions – sometimes leading to outcomes, as Mohammed and David discovered, that vary on the basis of ethnicity and gender. It’s a different world to the one regulators and competition authorities were set up to govern. ([Location 994](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=994))
- It’s an idea known as price discrimination and it says prices should reflect not just the characteristics of a product itself but also those of the person buying the product. ([Location 1008](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1008))
- These practical realities of the way markets worked helped to give capitalism its lustre in the post-war era – a feeling that we soon took for granted, assuming it arose from timeless economic laws. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1031))
- Big data tells companies with ever-rising accuracy who is – and who is not – price-sensitive. Companies can then act on that information, tailoring their websites and apps to show different prices and product recommendations to each customer. ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1037))
- In the last ten years, consumers in Britain have overpaid for essential bills by an estimated £45 billion. ([Location 1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1066))
- It was in September 2020 that the FCA finally lost patience, taking an impressive step that hinted at the bold new approach to regulation that is now emerging. It was a radical move that would have been unthinkable just a few years earlier – and that confirmed how deeply some of the old tenets of economic regulation are now being questioned: the regulator announced that it intended to ban the practice of surreptitiously increasing people’s bills altogether. They forecast that the move would save consumers £3.7 billion over ten years, although the change is unlikely to come into play until 2022. ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1086))
- Artificial Intelligence hasn’t quite reached the heights some people have predicted – the capability to hold a conversation, or write good novels, poetry or music, still evades even the smartest machine. There is, however, one thing AI is seriously good at: if you give a machine learning algorithm a tightly defined, quantifiable objective, and some rules, it can find the best strategy from millions of possible options. That’s why AI excels at board games – the goals and rules are clear, so the algorithm can learn by simulating millions of approaches. What’s happening today is that companies are putting this ability to work on the biggest game of them all: making a profit in a competitive market. As early as 2015, a third of all vendors on Amazon were using algorithms to set prices. ([Location 1098](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1098))
- In 2018, I met with a senior figure from the FCA and we talked through the worries that were keeping them up at night. There was one big idea near the top of the list: a new possibility that algorithms might start their own price-fixing game, as the algorithms of different companies start to herd, matching each other’s prices. Academics have tested the theory and say the FCA are right to worry. In one experiment, researchers set up artificially intelligent pricing algorithms and then watched them compete. Even relatively simple algorithms systematically hit on a strategy of collusion; they even developed their own sophisticated systems of reward and punishment to make sure other algorithms stayed in line. The conclusion was ominous: ‘the algorithms learn to collude by trial and error, with no prior knowledge of the environment in which they operate, without communicating with one another, and without being specifically designed or instructed to collude’.9 They formed an algorithmic cartel without leaving fingerprints, an almost untraceable crime. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1113))
- They pursued a tried and tested tactic: embrace the language of fairness, while arguing for slower regulatory responses or voluntary approaches, and then fighting any tougher action tooth and nail in court. When I chatted with company lobbyists in private, they often acknowledged that they hated where their industry had landed, but what choice did they have? With all their competitors behaving the same way, how could they not engage in these behaviours? ([Location 1139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1139))
- The first is the idea of principles-based regulation, in which the government – via independent regulators – moves away from prescriptive, rule-based regulation, to focus more on the outcomes markets deliver. Regulators would publish a short list of outcomes, or intuitive principles, that they expect companies to meet or adhere to; an example would be to treat your customers fairly. This would replace the exhaustive list of banned activities that typified regulation in the past, so that instead of ticking off a checklist companies would have to make sure they’re complying with the overall principle instead. ([Location 1166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1166))
- As it’s become clearer how quickly markets now adapt to and game the rules set by regulators, the idea of a principles-based approach has become more appealing. ([Location 1174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1174))
- Focusing more on outcomes also changes how compliance works, shifting responsibility from the regulator to companies themselves. ([Location 1181](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1181))
- One of the recognised challenges of deep learning and neural networks is their so-called ‘opacity’; we don’t know – and perhaps can’t know – why these algorithms make the decisions they make.* This leaves us with little option but to focus on what emerges from the box – taking a principles- or outcomes-based approach instead. ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1205))
- This means applying the insights of nudge theory to the way choices are structured in markets. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1219))
- The problem isn’t a lack of information. The problem is the choice architecture; the way the decision is structured. ([Location 1234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1234))

- If they’re implemented well, both of these new approaches would make regulation bolder, but they would also make regulation simpler, leaving fewer detailed rules – you might even say they cut red tape, a particular benefit for start-ups, which often get tangled in regulations.

- The basic intention each time was similar: governments did their best to divide the poor into categories. The crucial distinction was between people who were deemed ‘impotent’ – the elderly, sick, disabled and ‘feeble-minded’ – who could not work, and people who were ‘idle’ – people who were poor but ultimately able to work. These categories translated into the way people were treated. For people who could not work, support tended to last longer and come with fewer harsh requirements. Those who were judged able-bodied, however, had a different experience. The ‘voluntary poor’ owed their position to moral weakness; in short, they were lazy – and it was believed that laziness could be cured.

They either give up seeking help, sailing clean through the safety net, or they get tangled up in it, first trying to understand the many outmoded and counter-intuitive ways it categorises their lives, and then waiting weeks for help even as their income changes on an hourly basis.

- The appeal of a basic income is obvious; in its simplest form, the policy would help to solve all the problems described in this chapter. It replaces that black box of benefit formulas with a single predictable amount, so that people know reliably how much they will receive. It is paid to everyone without conditions, so that people aren’t put through complex tests and don’t have to wait for slow decisions. The money isn’t taken away as your income rises – other than in the same way all income is taxed – and, as a consequence, low-income people are not faced with steep climbs out of poverty. It is empowering because people are given the money up front and trusted over how they’ll spend it. A basic income abandons the false precision and moralising science of deciding who is and is not deserving, so it is less stigmatising too. And, because it’s always there and not conditional on antiquated models of national insurance, it is future-proofed, functioning well for gig economy workers, self-employed people and whatever else the future holds.

- Michael Tubbs, the mayor responsible for launching the Stockton experiment, believes that by reducing stigma a UBI could also be a powerful weapon in the fight against racism.36 Tubbs notes that the narrative of poverty in America is deeply racist; ‘when we think of the conversation about dignity and work and “lazy unemployed people”, in the American psyche that person is black’. By showing that poverty can be tackled by giving people cash, he believes a UBI could help to challenge ‘the structures that institutionalise and perpetuate inequities, especially along lines of race’.37 ([Location 1748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=1748))
- As we move deeper into the twenty-first century, we could shift the emphasis of benefit policy away from achieving a perfectly economically efficient allocation of spending, and pursue instead a broader set of goals – outcomes like inclusivity, respect, clarity, mobility, empowerment and broad and sustainable public support.

Meanwhile our lives themselves are becoming more changeable as more people live with fluctuating mental and physical health conditions, and domains of life from relationships to housing become more fluid too.

- Perez’s argument is that new technologies – really fundamental breakthroughs like steam power, electricity or the transistor – change the world in a series of overlapping waves. First, the new technology is discovered and it starts to disrupt a few specialist industries. Then its potential becomes clear, and it spreads across the economy in a frenzy of investment, causing dangerous instability and inequality. Then, after several decades of transition, things settle down into a new technological era. Organisations get the hang of the new way of doing things, and a calmer, more mature way of using the new technology becomes the norm. This last phase is when the real benefits of the new technology start to be felt and is what Perez calls the ‘golden age’.

- Behind these feelings, we now know there was a powerful force propelling us forward.

The pattern Wright had described wasn’t particular to economic booms, it was a general feature of today’s jobs market.

- Employers were arguing, in essence, that wages reflect a worker’s productivity, so that people are paid what they are worth. After all, they reasoned, if any employer were to pay their staff less than they were worth, another employer would simply offer them a pay rise to work for them instead. The market would do its magic, so that wages would settle at the level of a worker’s productivity. This logic had a simple implication: if the state meddled in the jobs market by forcing an employer to pay a worker more than they were worth, the natural balance would be upset. The employer would now be spending more on wages than they made by employing the person, so they would have no choice but to make the worker redundant. The minimum wage would thus backfire, harming low-paid people by reviving that slumbering giant: mass unemployment.

- One study of a large American retailer, for example, showed that productivity rose when the minimum wage went up and workers seemed to respond by putting more effort into their work.23 Economists think this is partly because better-paid workers feel more motivated – something companies should realise for themselves, but often don’t, instead opting myopically to pay as little as they can.

- Most supporters of the living wage would acknowledge that the campaign on its own isn’t enough, accepting that a systemic challenge like low pay inevitably also requires deeper, more structural solutions, whether by giving workers more power through unions or by using the legal powers of the state.

- This goal should be defined in the only ethically defensible way: everyone who works full-time should earn enough to live a decent life.

In 1948, enrolments still numbered over two million with veterans making up 40 per cent.41 In all, across the five years following the war, against the 500,000 to one million predicted, eight million veterans – more than half of all GIs and nearly 6 per cent of the entire US population at the time – took advantage of the GI Bill’s support for education.42 Altschuler and Blumin call it ‘without question, one of the largest and most comprehensive government initiatives ever enacted in the United States’.

- This didn’t just incrementally improve people’s skills; it catapulted people – or, rather, it catapulted working-class white men – into the upper echelons of life.

- There was one final aspect of the GI Bill that carries lessons for today; it trusted veterans to choose their futures themselves. Rather than selecting courses for people, or tethering training to the perceived needs of existing employers, the GI Bill paid for courses that veterans themselves thought would give them a foothold in the future. ([Location 2608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=2608))
- Setting their sights high and squarely on the future, they signed up in their thousands for degrees in engineering, science, business administration and, to people’s particular surprise, liberal arts. The choices proved perfectly suited for the kinds of jobs veterans would go on to do in the post-war economy.

- If employers had been starved of those skills, wage gaps would have risen, and a small elite of high-skilled workers would have monopolised the proceeds of the new era, securing huge wage premiums and making the 1950s and 1960s a decade of inequality. Instead, the opposite happened. As millions of people were equipped with valuable skills, the benefits of technological change were broadly shared.

- Vets who used the GI Bill for a college degree or vocational training programme went on to earn $10,000 to $15,000 more a year than those who didn’t. Overall, it is estimated that every $1 invested in the bill’s education provisions generated $5 to $12.50 of economic benefits for the US economy, putting the total value of the programme as high as $68 billion.59 ([Location 2644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=2644))
- So how could we apply the lessons of the GI Bill today? First, if we want to crack open the opportunities of the digital age we will have to go big. If we were to replicate the scale of the original GI Bill in the UK population today – while making the support available not just to veterans, but to other groups too – this would mean helping the equivalent of nearly four million people to retrain; in the US the equivalent figure today would be nearly nineteen million. This means working at an entirely different scale to the wheezes and fiddles that are typical of adult skills policy.

- Third, a new GI Bill would aim to be disruptive, shaking up the calcified world of top academic institutions and packing the halls of red brick and Russell Group universities – and of new digital training providers – with people who, without support, would never make it there.

- Bosses realised that longer hours were unsustainable and not the best way to maximise profit.

([Location 2811](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=2811))
- What energised this movement was a growing sense of anger from workers themselves. Working hours had, by the late nineteenth century, become a highly politicised topic – arguably even more so than wages. When work moved from fields and home workrooms into factories, it wasn’t just the physical conditions that changed; people also felt that their freedom had been taken away. Work had shifted from being arduous but, at least to a limited degree, autonomous, to a world in which bosses determined every aspect of how and when work was done.* The question of working hours, now completely out of the control of workers, thus became hotly political, fuelling rising resentment that blew on the embers of class identity.

- Excess work doesn’t just harm productivity by causing physical fatigue. We now better understand the role that downtime and leisure play in work itself. The latest research suggests that our brains are still working even when we have time off, in a similar fashion to our bodies when we rest after physical sports. As any top trainer will tell you, for elite athletes, recovery time is no less important than training time. The best athletes work intensely and then have a good break, during which their muscles build. The brain works in a similar way.

- She refined a model known as self-management, in which patients are empowered to monitor and treat their own symptoms, rather than being diagnosed and prescribed a treatment by a clinician. Lorig, who had herself been diagnosed with Gaucher’s disease at the age of three, understood how important it was for people to feel a sense of control over any long-term illness. Traditional healthcare, however, seemed to have the opposite effect, disempowering patients with chronic conditions, either by telling them nothing could be done, or by turning them into passive recipients of a treatment.

- Across the developed world, children with working-age parents have slipped down the rankings of income, with millions falling into poverty even as economies grew. This helps to explain one of the only consistent trends seen in happiness data: parents of school-age children are, on average, less happy than other age groups, a result that appears to correlate directly with the family-friendliness – or unfriendliness – of a country’s public policy decisions.28 ([Location 3868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=3868))
- For working-age people, we talk about the idea of a universal basic income as if it’s a sci-fi policy from the future, a brave idea floated by radicals and dismissed by centrists as naive utopianism. Yet for older people – incidentally, a group that is more small-c conservative on average than the general population – we already have a universal basic income, paid regularly by the government, given to almost everyone at a flat rate, never taken away and covering your basic needs. It’s called the state pension. ([Location 3880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=3880))

- The idea has also been debated in Austria, with Pieter Vanhuysse, professor of political science, arguing that ‘the time is ripe for [. . .] a clear-headed and empirically informed democratic debate about the radical idea of giving each parent one half extra vote, to be used on behalf of each under-age child’.39 ([Location 3950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=3950))
- The argument for proxy votes for children is simple: children are people, so they have the right to democratic representation. It’s a claim that most reasonable people would agree with – after all, when we deny children the right to vote, it’s not because we don’t think children deserve representation; it’s because we don’t think they’re mature enough to exercise that right. By giving proxy votes to parents, we sidestep this problem: parents choose for their children. As their children get older, the idea is that parents increasingly engage their children in this choice until, at eighteen, or younger, they hand over the baton, as children gain the right to cast their own vote.

- The instinct to do the best for your kids is strong, and it’s plausible to think parents would approach voting in the same way. Perhaps casting a proxy vote would even have the opposite effect to the one critics claim – it might prompt parents to scrutinise how political parties are planning for future generations, making their own vote more future-oriented as well.

- But it seems to me the core claim here – that proxy votes undermine children’s rights – doesn’t really line up with the wider way we think about parenting. Consider all the other decisions we already allow parents to make on behalf of their children. Parents can choose the school their child attends, the food they eat, the house they live in, the religion they follow and their access to bank accounts and other services. They can even choose their step-parents. It’s hard to see how those things are OK but a vote crosses the line.

- Governments already link many thousands of pounds of benefit entitlements to having children, and this has been shown to have at most a small effect on birth rates, so it takes a real fan of democracy to believe that giving people an extra vote would have any significant effect.

- Whether by giving parents proxy votes, or by extending the voting age to sixteen or even lower, it seems clear something has to be done. If we’re going to tackle crucial future challenges like climate change, we’ll need to marshal the voices and ideas of the people who will be impacted the most – the young.

- What does it really mean, concretely, to say that the state isn’t ready for the twenty-first century? And what can we do about a problem like this anyway? ([Location 4093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4093))
- From a distance, it’s too easy to misinterpret ‘digital reform’ as little more than upgrading a few websites or moving government services online. In fact, it represents something more profound than this: replacing an old paradigm of government with a new one. ([Location 4096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4096))
- To understand any government, you have to know how its civil service operates. Civil servants are, in a sense, a government’s component parts – commonly referred to as the cogs in the machine, they formulate the policies that are decided on by politicians, and they execute those policies once a decision is made. ([Location 4113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4113))
- To think of this as a ‘new world’ is, in fact, a little misleading. In reality, it’s a half world, still in formation. Gradually, a new form of government is being built, and, today, we are still in the midst of this change. ([Location 4135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4135))

- In government digital circles, the early days of GDS have accumulated a lustre of fame, embroidered with a folklore of memorable moments. There was the meeting in a pub in Lambeth North, when GDS staff sketched the first designs for GOV.UK, the award-winning website that would go on to replace that mess of legacy government sites. Or the moment in 2011 when the team wrote on Post-it notes the first cut of the GDS ‘design rules’, a list of principles for how to do good digital work in government – principles that would, after many iterations, be adapted for use in forward-thinking organisations around the world. ([Location 4164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4164))
- One early priority, for example, was to tackle incumbent technology suppliers. The firms were ejected as GDS banned contracts over £100 million, ended automatic contract renewal and committed to use open source software and small providers. ([Location 4171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4171))
- GDS wanted to introduce to government methodologies and mindsets that had emerged from software companies over many decades. It was an approach no less methodical or robust than the one civil servants were used to, but it was jarringly different, stemming from entirely different assumptions about the way work should be done. ([Location 4185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4185))
- The false comfort of detailed delivery plans was replaced with honesty about unknowns, so that projects started by defining a problem to solve while accepting that the solution would only emerge later. ([Location 4201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4201))
- At the heart of the new approach was the most radical change of all: GDS asked the public what they thought. ([Location 4204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4204))

- GDS had made a high-profile commitment to digitise twenty-five ‘exemplar’ government services – like registering to vote, registering a patent or viewing a driving licence online – by March 2015. When the deadline for the work arrived, however, only fifteen of the services were fully live while five were still being tested with the public and five weren’t ready at all. GDS’s new ways of working had caused frictions that strained their relationships with government departments. Despite the teams working flat out, it was nearly impossible to keep up the pace when two such distinct working styles were trying to work hand in hand. ([Location 4217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4217))
- Superficial changes, or changes that focused mainly on upgrading technology or digitising services, clearly wouldn’t be enough. ([Location 4232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4232))

- In one of his last speeches before leaving, Mike Bracken announced a new strategy for GDS that dialled up the level of radicalism. Labelled ‘government as a platform’, the idea drew on the lessons GDS had learned while trying to digitise those twenty-five exemplar public services. As GDS had worked with departments to digitise these services, it had become clear just how duplicative the process was. Most government services, it turned out, could be boiled down to a list of steps; actions like verifying your identity, booking an appointment, making a payment, and being updated on the status of your application.

- By now, however, GDS had learned another powerful lesson: the main barrier to digital reform was not technology, it was organisational culture – those demands for detailed upfront project plans, or the refusal to allow teams to test their software in the open with the public. It was this insight – that culture sits at the heart of digital reform – that had motivated those design rules that were scribbled on to Post-its in GDS’s early days – an attempt to articulate some model ways of working. By 2015, it was clear this wasn’t enough, so digital reformers put renewed effort into codifying the cultures and behaviours required for good digital work. ([Location 4252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4252))
- When I reflect on this history of government reform, I find it helps me understand the task reformers face today. It explains those roots that digital reformers are coming up against – the deep-set ways of thinking that were developed, paradoxically, by a previous generation of reformers. And it helps to explain why people are so reluctant to give up these old ideas. These old approaches aren’t in any way daft or malicious. In fact, when they were first introduced, they were a big improvement on what came before – it’s just that the world has now moved on again. ([Location 4435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4435))
- Traditional behavioural norms – ideals like discretion or objectivity and a narrow emphasis on economic reasoning – once helped to professionalise the government. Today, however, they often lead the state to be closed or coldly formal in the way it interacts with the public, making it hard to work in the open and to ask people what they think about a service. For digital reformers, it’s the dissonance of these two paradigms – one old, one new, but both operating side by side, as one dials up and the other dials down – that makes the work so damn hard. ([Location 4443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4443))
- This work still, to the credit of public-spirited reformers, outshines most digital work in traditional private sector corporations. ([Location 4458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4458))
- When good work is done, it’s typically not because deep structural or cultural issues have been resolved in favour of internet-era ways of working; the silos, for example, and the hierarchical decision-making processes are still there. It’s because some space has been carved out so that a small number of teams or projects can shelter from the wind, while the main aspects of government – from organisational structures, to the way budgets and accountability function – carry on largely as before. ([Location 4466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4466))
- What if the people working to reform government today could pause the world for six months, to address the deeper anachronisms in the state? What would happen if we had the luxury of time and headspace to ask the really big questions? What if we could take a breath to consider what a government built from scratch for the twenty-first century would look like? ([Location 4483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4483))
- We would establish permanent, well-funded units in the centre of government to build, own and maintain a public digital infrastructure. These would not be projects, to be disbanded once the work was ‘finished’, but permanent and vital capabilities at the heart of the state. ([Location 4499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4499))
- This power would come with responsibility and accountability – these central teams would not work in a top-down way, but in deep collaboration with departments, and the minister overseeing these functions would remain accountable to Parliament, with this role itself being one of the most important in government. ([Location 4504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4504))
- The future Whitehall would be more fluid than this, with clusters of services and those cross-cutting platform teams, and other structures too, such as communities of professionals – coders or UX designers, for example – sharing their skills across government, and across departmental boundaries. ([Location 4525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4525))
- The shift that’s needed here is the one GDS started and that many brilliant digital teams in departments have continued: a move away from rigid plans and detailed business cases to fund enduring teams to solve problems, each working in an iterative way; and an end to secrecy and discretion, so that the work done in government is open by default, and so that policies and services are tested constantly with the people who use them. ([Location 4528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4528))
- That will require a new generation of leaders to be appointed, fast-tracking people with a native understanding of digital technology into permanent secretary and director general roles, so that change flows from the top. It means civil servants at all levels, but particularly in leadership roles, need to be recruited on the basis of values like openness, comfort with change, humility and a commitment to user-centred design – and needless to say a deep understanding of internet-era technologies. ([Location 4532](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4532))
- To some people this will all sound inconceivably radical – an act of vandalism that would wreck many decades of priceless tradition. To others, these ideas will sound positively timid. ([Location 4543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4543))
- Of all the fascinating books I’ve read in the last few years, one of the most thought-provoking is called The Government Machine.

- Its organisational structures will be flat, autonomous and multidisciplinary; its relationship to the citizen will be enabling, not prescriptive or didactic; its processes will be fluid, iterative and open; and its dominant discipline won’t be economics – it will be design.

- To the east of the Eiffel Tower, via a walk through Les Invalides to the Musée Social, there was a social economy pavilion, housing a fringe festival for social reform. Here, visitors explored model workers’ cottages and browsed cabinets packed with pamphlets, monographs and charts. France showcased its burgeoning movement of cooperatives and mutual savings societies. The UK exhibited Charles Booth’s poverty maps of London. Germany won the day, however, with an obelisk dedicated to its landmark social insurance scheme to pool risks among industrial workers. ([Location 4609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4609))
- Reformers were assembling institutional equipment, no less ingenious than the industrial machines themselves, to harness a new form of capitalism for social ends. To steer the beast in a humane direction. ([Location 4616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4616))
- Capitalism is morphing once again into a new creature: a pixelated, digital dragon that is awe-inspiring and terrifying in equal measure. To help humanity ride this dragon, those reformers are assembling new tools and techniques; enough to fill a social economy pavilion of our own. It’s a task just as critical as it was last time around. ([Location 4619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4619))
- The new generation of reformers also reach beyond economics – a discipline that, in the last seventy years, has come to dominate our public policy discourse – to draw on other disciplines, particularly behavioural psychology and design. ([Location 4632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4632))
- The new reformers believe it’s literally impossible to run good services, or to design good public policies, without constant input from users. ([Location 4639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4639))
- The new state, in short, is bold, humble, simple, flat, trusting, open and warm. It is also built on a less orthodox understanding of the way markets work, drawing on psychology and behavioural economics to get under the skin of how markets function in reality. ([Location 4647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4647))
- The radical pandemic-era policies – the breathtakingly bold suite of interventions that have kept the economy alive through rolling lockdowns – will be stowed away safely, back behind the glass, ready for the next emergency. Politics, meanwhile, will slide back into its everyday routines: incrementalism, the pantomime of party positions, and a revolving cast of lobbyists who resist every tiny little change. ([Location 4663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4663))
- At a moment like this – as we adapt to a new technological revolution, and as a pandemic prompts us all to reflect on the kind of society we want – radicalism is an attractive quality for an idea to have. ([Location 4697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4697))
- It’s the meek ideas that should be greeted with arched eyebrows – the suggestions that we should fix broken markets, or unjust jobs, or burned out lives, by fiddling with taper rates or tax rates, or by announcing another new policy wheeze. Really? ([Location 4703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4703))
- So if bold ideas are necessary, and if these ideas can win support over time, how exactly do they win that support? Here’s where it all gets a bit grim. Because although positive social change is, in the long run, a safe bet, the process by which that change plays out – and in particular the process by which we transition from one form of capitalism to another – has tended to be what you could call a hot mess. Our collective efforts to tame industrial capitalism, from the time those intolerable social evils first emerged to the time we got them moderately under control, took – depending on your standards of what’s tolerable – anywhere from twenty-five to seventy-five years. ([Location 4707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4707))
- Typically, things got worse before they got better, as political elites were spooked into implementing new policy ideas or adopting new ways of governing largely against their will. Social evils tended to become unbearable before something was done. ([Location 4715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4715))
- Of the many battle lines that were drawn, one of the most important wasn’t the one between left and right but the one between the past and the future. It was a battle between people who felt nostalgic and wanted to turn back the clock, or who were dogmatic and orthodox in their beliefs, and people who were curious and hungry to make the most of the future. ([Location 4724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4724))
- Reflecting on history, however, I came to think that the political ambiguity of the ideas was just as reassuring as their boldness. After all, the radical policy reforms of the past didn’t fit neatly into old categories either. ([Location 4734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4734))
- All of this is to say that social change seems destined to stay messy, unpredictable and complex. In a sense, only one thing is straightforward: things need to change – and in the end, they inevitably will. ([Location 4746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4746))
- If there’s one takeaway from this book it’s that this strange new brand of social atomism is a recipe for disaster. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve got nothing against a tidy bedroom. But what an odd priority at an historic moment like this. ([Location 4756](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4756))
- Social progress – the kind of step-change progress that makes the world better – doesn’t come when we each turn inward. It comes when we turn outward and realise we can only build a better future together. ([Location 4761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4761))
- There aren’t really any shortcuts here; we have to do the work. But if there’s one force that can help the whole thing along, it’s believing that a better future is possible. When you look at history’s big strides forward, so many of them were propelled by a surge of belief. Belief is so vital to the mechanisms by which change happens: it keeps anger fresh so that it doesn’t wilt into fatalism; it inspires campaigners to argue for unpopular ideas even when it feels risky to do so, or when they’re laughed out of the room; and it gets reformers out of bed in the morning as they head off for another hard day grafting at organisational change. ([Location 4768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4768))

- So here’s my medium-sized reason for optimism: the process of social change, once it’s reached the point we’re at now, is really hard to stop. New policy ideas don’t just appear overnight; they grow roots quietly for years before shoots become visible.

- Here, though, is the one big thing that keeps my belief in the future alive. Behind all the uncertainty we feel about the twenty-first century, there’s a powerful fact: the digital economy – this strange beast that is still emerging in front of our eyes – has more potential than the economy that came before. ([Location 4801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4801))
- The task of social reform, then, isn’t to slow down, resist, or submit reluctantly to the digital economy, glancing back longingly over our shoulder. The task is to ease, smooth and, if anything, accelerate this transition, because it’s our best hope of achieving what we want: a society that is richer, healthier, happier – and, yes, fairer, more equitable and greener. ([Location 4809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4809))
- None of these things will happen automatically. This isn’t a techno-utopian fantasy in which we can sit back, relax and float happily downstream. When you find yourself on the back of a dragon, relaxing isn’t the best idea; there is work to be done – and it needs our full attention. As we learn to ride, there will be good times, when we feel we’re starting to master the task, and there will be bad times when we slip and fear being thrown from the saddle. But in the long run, history suggests we can pull this off – and that, when we do, it will be worth it. There’s no doubt that being on the back of a dragon can feel terrifying. But riding a dragon. Imagine that. ([Location 4817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DHXNYR3&location=4817))
