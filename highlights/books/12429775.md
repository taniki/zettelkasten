## Highlights
- Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate. ([Location 58](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=58))
- Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate. ([Location 102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=102))

- The idea that network tools are pushing our work from the deep toward the shallow is not new. The Shallows was just the first in a series of recent books to examine the Internet’s effect on our brains and work habits. These subsequent titles include William Powers’s Hamlet’s BlackBerry, John Freeman’s The Tyranny of E-mail, and Alex Soojung-Kin Pang’s The Distraction Addiction—all of which agree, more or less, that network tools are distracting us from work that requires unbroken concentration, while simultaneously degrading our capacity to remain focused. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=112))
- I build my days around a core of carefully chosen deep work, with the shallow activities I absolutely cannot avoid batched into smaller bursts at the peripheries of my schedule. Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.

- As Brynjolfsson and McAfee emphasize, this Great Restructuring is not driving down all jobs but is instead dividing them. Though an increasing number of people will lose in this new economy as their skill becomes automatable or easily outsourced, there are others who will not only survive, but thrive—becoming more valued (and therefore more rewarded) than before. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=282))
- Intelligent machines are not an obstacle to Silver’s success, but instead provide its precondition. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=297))
- This same trend holds for the growing number of fields where technology makes productive remote work possible—consulting, marketing, writing, design, and so on. Once the talent market is made universally accessible, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=307))
- There’s a premium to being the best. Therefore, if you’re in a marketplace where the consumer has access to all performers, and everyone’s q value is clear, the consumer will choose the very best. Even if the talent advantage of the best is small compared to the next rung down on the skill ladder, the superstars still win the bulk of the market. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=313))
- In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=339))
- Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy The ability to quickly master hard things. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=352))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- And because these technologies change rapidly, this process of mastering hard things never ends: You must be able to do it quickly, again and again. ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=376))
- If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=391))
- This task of formalization began in earnest in the 1970s, when a branch of psychology, sometimes called performance psychology, began to systematically explore what separates experts (in many different fields) from everyone else. In the early 1990s, K. Anders Ericsson, a professor at Florida State University, pulled together these strands into a single coherent answer, consistent with the growing research literature, that he gave a punchy name: deliberate practice. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=411))
- This brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=424))
- To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=446))
- Grant also batches his attention on a smaller time scale. Within a semester dedicated to research, he alternates between periods where his door is open to students and colleagues, and periods where he isolates himself to focus completely and without distraction on a single research task. ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=472))
- The results from this and her similar experiments were clear: “People experiencing attention residue after switching tasks are likely to demonstrate poor performance on that next task,” and the more intense the residue, the worse the performance. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=506))
- When we step back from these individual observations, we see a clear argument form: To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work. If you’re not comfortable going deep for extended periods of time, it’ll be difficult to get your performance to the peak levels of quality and quantity increasingly necessary to thrive professionally. Unless your talent and skills absolutely dwarf those of your competition, the deep workers among them will outproduce you.

- To summarize, big trends in business today actively decrease people’s ability to perform deep work, even though the benefits promised by these trends (e.g., increased serendipity, faster responses to requests, and more exposure) are arguably dwarfed by the benefits that flow from a commitment to deep work (e.g., the ability to learn hard things fast and produce at an elite level). ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=627))
- My objective is to convince you that although our current embrace of distraction is a real phenomenon, it’s built on an unstable foundation and can be easily dismissed once you decide to cultivate a deep work ethic. ([Location 632](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=632))
- The reality of this metric black hole is the backdrop for the arguments that follow in this chapter. In these upcoming sections, I’ll describe various mind-sets and biases that have pushed business away from deep work and toward more distracting alternatives. None of these behaviors would survive long if it was clear that they were hurting the bottom line, but the metric black hole prevents this clarity and allows the shift toward distraction we increasingly encounter in the professional world. ([Location 667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=667))
- In researching this topic, Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow found that the professionals she surveyed spent around twenty to twenty-five hours a week outside the office monitoring e-mail—believing it important to answer any e-mail (internal or external) within an hour of its arrival. ([Location 673](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=673))
- The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment. ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=690))
- If you work in an environment where you can get an answer to a question or a specific piece of information immediately when the need arises, this makes your life easier—at least, in the moment. If you couldn’t count on this quick response time you’d instead have to do more advance planning for your work, be more organized, and be prepared to put things aside for a while and turn your attention elsewhere while waiting for what you requested. All of this would make the day to day of your working life harder (even if it produced more satisfaction and a better outcome in the long term). ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=694))
- If e-mail were to move to the periphery of your workday, you’d be required to deploy a more thoughtful approach to figuring out what you should be working on and for how long. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=702))
- Clarity about what matters provides clarity about what does not. ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=741))
- They want to prove that they’re productive members of the team and are earning their keep, but they’re not entirely clear what this goal constitutes. They have no rising h-index or rack of repaired motorcycles to point to as evidence of their worth. To overcome this gap, many seem to be turning back to the last time when productivity was more universally observable: the industrial age. ([Location 751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=751))
- Knowledge workers, I’m arguing, are tending toward increasingly visible busyness because they lack a better way to demonstrate their value. ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=759))
- Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=761))
- If you’re using busyness as a proxy for productivity, then these behaviors can seem crucial for convincing yourself and others that you’re doing your job well. ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=766))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] 
- Knowledge work is not an assembly line, and extracting value from information is an activity that’s often at odds with busyness, not supported by it. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=773))
- As we’ll see next, however, even those who have a clear understanding of what it means to succeed in their knowledge work job can still be lured away from depth. All it takes is an ideology seductive enough to convince you to discard common sense. ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=781))
- In Morozov’s critique, we’ve made “the Internet” synonymous with the revolutionary future of business and government. To make your company more like “the Internet” is to be with the times, and to ignore these trends is to be the proverbial buggy-whip maker in an automotive age. We no longer see Internet tools as products released by for-profit companies, funded by investors hoping to make a return, and run by twentysomethings who are often making things up as they go along. We’re instead quick to idolize these digital doodads as a signifier of progress and a harbinger of a (dare I say, brave) new world. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=810))
- Deep work is at a severe disadvantage in a technopoly because it builds on values like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery that are decidedly old-fashioned and nontechnological. ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=829))
- Even if your colleagues are all genial and your interactions are always upbeat and positive, by allowing your attention to drift over the seductive landscape of the shallow, you run the risk of falling into another neurological trap identified by Gallagher: “Five years of reporting on attention have confirmed some home truths,” Gallagher reports. “[Among them is the notion that] ‘the idle mind is the devil’s workshop’ … when you lose focus, your mind tends to fix on what could be wrong with your life instead of what’s right.” A workday driven by the shallow, from a neurological perspective, is likely to be a draining and upsetting day, even if most of the shallow things that capture your attention seem harmless or fun. ([Location 967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=967))
- Human beings, it seems, are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging. ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1003))
- Gallagher’s writing emphasizes that the content of what we focus on matters. If we give rapt attention to important things, and therefore also ignore shallow negative things, we’ll experience our working life as more important and positive. Csikszentmihalyi’s theory of flow, by contrast, is mostly agnostic to the content of our attention. Though he would likely agree with the research cited by Gallagher, his theory notes that the feeling of going deep is in itself very rewarding. Our minds like this challenge, regardless of the subject. ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1005))

- To build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction. ([Location 1019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1019))
- Craftsmanship, Dreyfus and Kelly argue in their book’s conclusion, provides a key to reopening a sense of sacredness in a responsible manner. ([Location 1038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1038))
- As Dreyfus and Kelly explain, such sacredness is common to craftsmanship. The task of a craftsman, they conclude, “is not to generate meaning, but rather to cultivate in himself the skill of discerning the meanings that are already there.” This frees the craftsman of the nihilism of autonomous individualism, providing an ordered world of meaning. At the same time, this meaning seems safer than the sources cited in previous eras. The wheelwright, the authors imply, cannot easily use the inherent quality of a piece of pine to justify a despotic monarchy. ([Location 1045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1045))
- Put another way, a wooden wheel is not noble, but its shaping can be. The same applies to knowledge work. You don’t need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work. ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1083))
- Willpower ([Location 1157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1157))
- You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. ([Location 1168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1168))
- The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration. ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1173))
- (This issue is so important to Stephenson that he went on to explore its implications—positive and negative—in his 2008 science fiction epic, Anathem, which considers a world where an intellectual elite live in monastic orders, isolated from the distracted masses and technology, thinking deep thoughts.) ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1239))
- His 2013 bestseller, Give and Take, promotes the practice of giving of your time and attention, without expectation of something in return, as a key strategy in professional advancement. ([Location 1283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1283))
- By reducing the need to make decisions about deep work moment by moment, I can preserve more mental energy for the deep thinking itself. ([Location 1381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1381))
- To maximize your success, you need to support your efforts to go deep. At the same time, this support needs to be systematized so that you don’t waste mental energy figuring out what you need in the moment. ([Location 1427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1427))
- Rowling’s decision to check into a luxurious hotel suite near Edinburgh Castle is an example of a curious but effective strategy in the world of deep work: the grand gesture. The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. This boost in importance reduces your mind’s instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy. ([Location 1446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1446))
- The dominant force is the psychology of committing so seriously to the task at hand. ([Location 1484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1484))
- This decision between promoting concentration and promoting serendipity seems to indicate that deep work (an individual endeavor) is incompatible with generating creative insights (a collaborative endeavor). This conclusion, however, is flawed. It’s based, I argue, on an incomplete understanding of the theory of serendipitous creativity. To support this claim, let’s consider the origins of this particular understanding of what spurs breakthroughs. ([Location 1508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1508))
- The key is to maintain both in a hub-and-spoke-style arrangement: Expose yourself to ideas in hubs on a regular basis, but maintain a spoke in which to work deeply on what you encounter. ([Location 1562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1562))
- The presence of the other party waiting for your next insight—be it someone physically in the same room or collaborating with you virtually—can short-circuit the natural instinct to avoid depth. ([Location 1578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1578))
- Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters from your efforts to think deeply and build on these inspirations. You should try to optimize each effort separately, as opposed to mixing them together into a sludge that impedes both goals. ([Location 1584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1584))
- When it comes to deep work, in other words, consider the use of collaboration when appropriate, as it can push your results to a new level. At the same time, don’t lionize this quest for interaction and positive randomness to the point where it crowds out the unbroken concentration ultimately required to wring something useful out of the swirl of ideas all around us.

- In other words, lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals. ([Location 1637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1637))

- unconscious thought theory (UTT)—an ([Location 1724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1724))
- Your conscious mind, according to this theory, is like a home computer on which you can run carefully written programs that return correct answers to limited problems, whereas your unconscious mind is like Google’s vast data centers, in which statistical algorithms sift through terabytes of unstructured information, teasing out surprising useful solutions to difficult questions.

- This study, it turns out, is one of many that validate attention restoration theory (ART), which claims that spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate. ([Location 1743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1743))
- The core mechanism of this theory is the idea that you can restore your ability to direct your attention if you give this activity a rest. ([Location 1761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1761))
- Put another way, trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day enough that you end up getting less done than if you had instead respected a shutdown. ([Location 1770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1770))
- Ericsson notes that for a novice, somewhere around an hour a day of intense concentration seems to be a limit, while for experts this number can expand to as many as four hours—but rarely more. ([Location 1779](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1779))
- Any work you do fit into the night, therefore, won’t be the type of high-value activities that really advance your career; your efforts will instead likely be confined to low-value shallow tasks (executed at a slow, low-energy pace). By deferring evening work, in other words, you’re not missing out on much of importance. ([Location 1786](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1786))
- From my experience, it should take a week or two before the shutdown habit sticks—that is, until your mind trusts your ritual enough to actually begin to release work-related thoughts in the evening. ([Location 1830](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1830))
- There is, however, an important corollary to this idea: Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction. Much in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies outside of their training sessions, you’ll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom. ([Location 1870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1870))
- improving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire for distraction. ([Location 1893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1893))
- Once you’re wired for distraction, you crave it. Motivated by this reality, this strategy is designed to help you rewire your brain to a configuration better suited to staying on task. ([Location 1899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1899))
- The idea motivating this strategy is that the use of a distracting service does not, by itself, reduce your brain’s ability to focus. It’s instead the constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty. This constant switching can be understood analogously as weakening the mental muscles responsible for organizing the many sources vying for your attention. By segregating Internet use (and therefore segregating distractions) you’re minimizing the number of times you give in to distraction, and by doing so you let these attention-selecting muscles strengthen. ([Location 1923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1923))
- The key in making this change, however, is to not schedule the next Internet block to occur immediately. Instead, enforce at least a five-minute gap between the current moment and the next time you can go online. This gap is minor, so it won’t excessively impede your progress, but from a behavioralist perspective, it’s substantial because it separates the sensation of wanting to go online from the reward of actually doing so. ([Location 1954](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1954))
- As in the workplace variation of this strategy, if the Internet plays a large and important role in your evening entertainment, that’s fine: Schedule lots of long Internet blocks. The key here isn’t to avoid or even to reduce the total amount of time you spend engaging in distracting behavior, but is instead to give yourself plenty of opportunities throughout your evening to resist switching to these distractions at the slightest hint of boredom. ([Location 1965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1965))
- To summarize, to succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention. The simple strategy proposed here of scheduling Internet blocks goes a long way toward helping you regain this attention autonomy. ([Location 1973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1973))
- This strategy asks you to inject the occasional dash of Rooseveltian intensity into your own workday. In particular, identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep work to complete) that’s high on your priority list. Estimate how long you’d normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time. If possible, commit publicly to the deadline—for example, by telling the person expecting the finished project when they should expect it. If this isn’t possible (or if it puts your job in jeopardy), then motivate yourself by setting a countdown timer on your phone and propping it up where you can’t avoid seeing it as you work. ([Location 1998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=1998))
- The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. ([Location 2029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2029))
- Fortunately, finding time for this strategy is easy, as it takes advantage of periods that would otherwise be wasted (such as walking the dog or commuting to work), and if done right, can actually increase your professional productivity instead of taking time away from your work. In fact, you might even consider scheduling a walk during your workday specifically for the purpose of applying productive meditation to your most pressing problem at the moment.

- By forcing you to resist distraction and return your attention repeatedly to a well-defined problem, it helps strengthen your distraction-resisting muscles, and by forcing you to push your focus deeper and deeper on a single problem, it sharpens your concentration. ([Location 2043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2043))
- “Thinking deeply” about a problem seems like a self-evident activity, but in reality it’s not. When faced with a distraction-free mental landscape, a hard problem, and time to think, the next steps can become surprisingly non-obvious. In my experience, it helps to have some structure for this deep thinking process. I suggest starting with a careful review of the relevant variables for solving the problem and then storing these values in your working memory. ([Location 2063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2063))
- Assuming you’re able to solve your next-step question, the final step of this structured approach to deep thinking is to consolidate your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified. ([Location 2071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2071))
- The ability in question is called “attentional control,” and it measures the subjects’ ability to maintain their focus on essential information. ([Location 2094](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2094))
- In particular, it asks you to learn a standard but quite impressive skill in the repertoire of most mental athletes: the ability to memorize a shuffled deck of cards. ([Location 2100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2100))
- More important than your ability to impress friends, of course, is the training such activities provide your mind. Proceeding through the steps described earlier requires that you focus your attention, again and again, on a clear target. Like a muscle responding to weights, this will strengthen your general ability to concentrate—allowing you to go deeper with more ease. ([Location 2139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2139))
- The key to this strategy is not the specifics, but instead the motivating idea that your ability to concentrate is only as strong as your commitment to train it. ([Location 2145](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2145))
- But I will ask you to reject the state of distracted hyperconnectedness that drove him to that drastic experiment in the first place.

- The first step of this strategy is to identify the main high-level goals in both your professional and your personal life. ([Location 2315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2315))
- Once you’ve identified these goals, list for each the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal. These activities should be specific enough to allow you to clearly picture doing them. On the other hand, they should be general enough that they’re not tied to a onetime outcome. ([Location 2322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2322))
- In other words, the question is not whether Twitter has some conceivable benefit to Lewis; it’s instead whether Twitter use significantly and positively affects the most important activities in his professional life. ([Location 2348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2348))
- The question once again is not whether Twitter offers some benefits, but instead whether it offers enough benefits to offset its drag on your time and attention (two resources that are especially valuable to a writer). ([Location 2355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2355))
- The Law of the Vital Few*: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes. ([Location 2392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2392))
- Assuming that you could probably list somewhere between ten and fifteen distinct and potentially beneficial activities for each of your life goals, this law says that it’s the top two or three such activities—the number that this strategy asks you to focus on—that make most of the difference in whether or not you succeed with the goal. ([Location 2400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2400))
- This argument, however, misses the key point that all activities, regardless of their importance, consume your same limited store of time and attention. If you service low-impact activities, therefore, you’re taking away time you could be spending on higher-impact activities. It’s a zero-sum game. And because your time returns substantially more rewards when invested in high-impact activities than when invested in low-impact activities, the more of it you shift to the latter, the lower your overall benefit. ([Location 2407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2407))
- This strategy picks specifically on social media because among the different network tools that can claim your time and attention, these services, if used without limit, can be particularly devastating to your quest to work deeper. They offer personalized information arriving on an unpredictable intermittent schedule—making them massively addictive and therefore capable of severely damaging your attempts to schedule and succeed with any act of concentration. Given these dangers, you might expect that more knowledge workers would avoid these tools altogether—especially those like computer programmers or writers whose livelihood explicitly depends on the outcome of deep work. But part of what makes social media insidious is that the companies that profit from your attention have succeeded with a masterful marketing coup: convincing our culture that if you don’t use their products you might miss out. ([Location 2449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2449))
- They can be fun, but in the scheme of your life and what you want to accomplish, they’re a lightweight whimsy, one unimportant distraction among many threatening to derail you from something deeper. Or maybe social media tools are at the core of your existence. You won’t know either way until you sample life without them. ([Location 2491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2491))
- What’s the alternative to this state of affairs? Bennett suggests that his typical man see his sixteen free hours as a “day within a day,” explaining, “during those sixteen hours he is free; he is not a wage-earner; he is not preoccupied with monetary cares; he is just as good as a man with a private income.” Accordingly, the typical man should instead use this time as an aristocrat would: to perform rigorous self-improvement—a task that, according to Bennett, involves, primarily, reading great literature and poetry. ([Location 2508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2508))
- In more detail, in the strategies discussed so far in this rule, we haven’t spent much time yet on a class of network tools that are particularly relevant to the fight for depth: entertainment-focused websites designed to capture and hold your attention for as long as possible. At the time of this writing, the most popular examples of such sites include the Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Business Insider, and Reddit. This list will undoubtedly continue to evolve, but what this general category of sites shares is the use of carefully crafted titles and easily digestible content, often honed by algorithms to be maximally attention catching. ([Location 2521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2521))
- To make matters worse, these network tools are not something you join and therefore they’re not something you can remove from your life by quitting (rendering the previous two strategies irrelevant). They’re always available, just a quick click away. ([Location 2533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2533))
- Put more thought into your leisure time. ([Location 2536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2536))
- If you instead fill this free time with something of more quality, their grip on your attention will loosen. ([Location 2539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2539))

- What? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change—not rest, except in sleep. ([Location 2552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2552))
- To summarize, if you want to eliminate the addictive pull of entertainment sites on your time and attention, give your brain a quality alternative. Not only will this preserve your ability to resist distraction and concentrate, but you might even fulfill Arnold Bennett’s ambitious goal of experiencing, perhaps for the first time, what it means to live, and not just exist.

- The implication is that once you’ve hit your deep work limit in a given day, you’ll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more. Shallow work, therefore, doesn’t become dangerous until after you add enough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day. ([Location 2621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2621))
- To summarize, I’m asking you to treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is often vastly underestimated and its importance vastly overestimated. This type of work is inevitable, but you must keep it confined to a point where it doesn’t impede your ability to take full advantage of the deeper efforts that ultimately determine your impact. ([Location 2634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2634))
- These examples underscore an important point: We spend much of our day on autopilot—not giving much thought to what we’re doing with our time. This is a problem. It’s difficult to prevent the trivial from creeping into every corner of your schedule if you don’t face, without flinching, your current balance between deep and shallow work, and then adopt the habit of pausing before action and asking, “What makes the most sense right now?” The strategy described in the following paragraphs is designed to force you into these behaviors. It’s an idea that might seem extreme at first but will soon prove indispensable in your quest to take full advantage of the value of deep work: Schedule every minute of your day. ([Location 2650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2650))
- And because you’re willing to abandon your plan when an innovative idea arises, you’re just as well suited as the distracted creative to follow up when the muse strikes. ([Location 2713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2713))
- To summarize, the motivation for this strategy is the recognition that a deep work habit requires you to treat your time with respect. A good first step toward this respectful handling is the advice outlined here: Decide in advance what you’re going to do with every minute of your workday. It’s natural, at first, to resist this idea, as it’s undoubtedly easier to continue to allow the twin forces of internal whim and external requests to drive your schedule. But you must overcome this distrust of structure if you want to approach your true potential as someone who creates things that matter.

- Here’s an important question that’s rarely asked: What percentage of my time should be spent on shallow work? This strategy suggests that you ask it. If you have a boss, in other words, have a conversation about this question. (You’ll probably have to first define for him or her what “shallow” and “deep” work means.) If you work for yourself, ask yourself this question. In both cases, settle on a specific answer. Then—and this is the important part—try to stick to this budget. (The strategies that precede and follow this one will help you achieve this goal.) ([Location 2772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2772))
- The tools from earlier in this rule, however, allow you to make this impact explicit. ([Location 2795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2795))
- Without these numbers, it’s difficult for an entrepreneur to say no to any opportunity that might generate some positive return. “I have to be on Twitter!,” “I have to maintain an active Facebook presence!,” “I have to tweak the widgets on my blog!,” you tell yourself, because when considered in isolation, to say no to any one of these activities seems like you’re being lazy. By instead picking and sticking with a shallow-to-deep ratio, you can replace this guilt-driven unconditional acceptance with the more healthy habit of trying to get the most out of the time you put aside for shallow work (therefore still exposing yourself to many opportunities), but keeping these efforts constrained to a small enough fraction of your time and attention to enable the deep work that ultimately drives your business forward.

- The Damoclean cap on the workday enforced by fixed-schedule productivity has a way of keeping my organization efforts sharp. Without this looming cutoff, I’d likely end up more lax in my habits. ([Location 2869](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B013UWFM52&location=2869))
- A commitment to fixed-schedule productivity, however, shifts you into a scarcity mind-set. Suddenly any obligation beyond your deepest efforts is suspect and seen as potentially disruptive. Your default answer becomes no, the bar for gaining access to your time and attention rises precipitously, and you begin to organize the efforts that pass these obstacles with a ruthless efficiency.

- The deep life, of course, is not for everybody. It requires hard work and drastic changes to your habits. For many, there’s a comfort in the artificial busyness of rapid e-mail messaging and social media posturing, while the deep life demands that you leave much of that behind. There’s also an uneasiness that surrounds any effort to produce the best things you’re capable of producing, as this forces you to confront the possibility that your best is not (yet) that good.
