## Highlights
- I had to rely on small habits to rebound from my injury, to get stronger in the gym, to perform at a high level on the field, to become a writer, to build a successful business, and simply to develop into a responsible adult. Small habits helped me fulfill my potential, and since you picked up this book, I’m guessing you’d like to fulfill yours as well. ([Location 180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=180))
- It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about. ([Location 247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=247))
- Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=278))
- That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=279))
- Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=284))
- Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=289))
- Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed. This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=323))
- What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=396))
- Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=403))
- It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. ([Location 406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=406))
- When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=407))
- This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=413))
- The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=414))
- Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth. ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=424))

- Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=460))
- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=496))
- Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements. ([Location 566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=566))
- Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=614))
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=623))
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself. ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=624))

- The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.fn1 ([Location 690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=690))
- What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=703))
- Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=705))
- Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving. ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=709))
- Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us. ([Location 715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=715))
- rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=720))
- In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=734))

- We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire. ([Location 741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=741))
- Your habits are shaped by the systems in your life. In the chapters that follow, we will discuss these laws one by one and show how you can use them to create a system in which good habits emerge naturally and bad habits wither away. ([Location 780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=780))
- With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically, your brain encodes the lessons learned through experience. We can’t always explain what it is we are learning, but learning is happening all along the way, and your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation for every habit you have. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=816))
- Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=858))
- Scoring your habits can be a bit more complex for another reason as well. The labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate. There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. ([Location 898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=898))
- The punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.7 Too many people try to change their habits without these basic details figured out. ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=956))
- Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some people spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make an improvement. ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=962))
- In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).3 ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1125))
- For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can imagine how important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones. ([Location 1150](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1150))
- Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a world others have created for them. But you can alter the spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it. ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1187))
- Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the influence of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. ([Location 1197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1197))
- Different people can have different memories—and thus different habits—associated with the same place. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1201))
- The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to change in a new environment.12 It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. ([Location 1207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1207))
- The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often.6 So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. ([Location 1276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1276))
- Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits. ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1290))
- When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.16 Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.17 ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1432))
- Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. ([Location 1475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1475))
- Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.”23 In other words, even if you don’t really want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along the way. ([Location 1492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1492))
- Humans are similar. There is tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it—you can choose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other people think—but it takes work. Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort. When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive. ([Location 1631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1631))
- We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). ([Location 1660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1660))
- The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. ([Location 1733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1733))
- Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future. Even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to feel differently than you do in the moment. When you binge-eat or light up or browse social media, what you really want is not a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch of likes. What you really want is to feel different. ([Location 1742](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1742))
- To summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives. Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment. ([Location 1750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1750))
- The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose. ([Location 1761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1761))
- The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an attractive one. ([Location 1800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1800))
- It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”2 I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result. Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action. ([Location 1852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1852))
- If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in. ([Location 1871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1871))
- repetition is a form of change. ([Location 1894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1894))
- All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.10 ([Location 1898](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1898))
- One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to build a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How many does it take to form a new habit?” That is, how many repetitions are required to make a habit automatic? There is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit formation. It doesn’t matter if it’s been twenty-one days or thirty days or three hundred days. What matters is the rate at which you perform the behavior. You could do something twice in thirty days, or two hundred times. It’s the frequency that makes the difference. Your current habits have been internalized over the course of hundreds, if not thousands, of repetitions. New habits require the same level of frequency. You need to string together enough successful attempts until the behavior is firmly embedded in your mind and you cross the Habit Line. In practice, it doesn’t really matter how long it takes for a habit to become automatic. What matters is that you take the actions you need to take to make progress. Whether an action is fully automatic is of less importance. ([Location 1915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1915))
- You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. ([Location 1975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1975))
- If you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life. ([Location 2012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2012))
- The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones. ([Location 2026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2026))
- Even when you know you should start small, it’s easy to start too big. When you dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes over and you end up trying to do too much too soon. The most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule, which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” ([Location 2119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2119))
- A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy. What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path. ([Location 2132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2132))
- The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details. Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize. ([Location 2139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2139))
- It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all. ([Location 2168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2168))
- A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future.2 It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. ([Location 2200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2200))
- When working in your favor, automation can make your good habits inevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is the ultimate way to lock in future behavior rather than relying on willpower in the moment. By utilizing commitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and technology, you can create an environment of inevitability—a space where good habits are not just an outcome you hope for but an outcome that is virtually guaranteed. ([Location 2292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2292))
- Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are often misaligned. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good. ([Location 2429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2429))
- The brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can’t rely on good intentions. When you make a plan—to lose weight, write a book, or learn a language—you are actually making plans for your future self. And when you envision what you want your life to be like, it is easy to see the value in taking actions with long-term benefits. We all want better lives for our future selves. However, when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually wins. You are no longer making a choice for Future You, who dreams of being fitter or wealthier or happier.19 You are choosing for Present You, who wants to be full, pampered, and entertained. As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.fn3 ([Location 2436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2436))
- Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded. ([Location 2445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2445))
- At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward. ([Location 2452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2452))
- And change is easy when it is enjoyable. ([Location 2493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2493))
- Jerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his streak of writing jokes. In the documentary Comedian, he explains that his goal is simply to “never break the chain” of writing jokes every day. In other words, he is not focused on how good or bad a particular joke is or how inspired he feels. He is simply focused on showing up and adding to his streak. “Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t break the chain of sales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t break the chain of workouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect. Don’t break the chain of creating every day and you will end up with an impressive portfolio.3 Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying. ([Location 2528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2528))
- Goodhart’s Law. ([Location 2627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2627))
- In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly think the factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all. ([Location 2630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2630))
- What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.

- Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we know where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be. ([Location 2935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2935))
- The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. ([Location 2987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2987))
- Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement. ([Location 3006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3006))
- But this coach was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom. ([Location 3019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3019))
- The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty. Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a never-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next, one diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon as we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy—even if the old one was still working. As Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”6 Perhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those that provide continuous forms of novelty. Video games provide visual novelty. Porn provides sexual novelty. Junk foods provide culinary novelty. Each of these experiences offer continual elements of surprise.

- Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce boredom. ([Location 3036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3036))
- But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur. ([Location 3051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3051))
- Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life. ([Location 3053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3053))
- When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood. Professionals take action even when the mood isn’t right. They might not enjoy it, but they find a way to put the reps in. ([Location 3056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3056))
- However, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better. ([Location 3075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3075))
- However, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve elite levels of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You can’t repeat the same things blindly and expect to become exceptional. Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice. ([Location 3085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3085))
- Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery ([Location 3087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3087))
- Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. Old tasks become easier the second time around, but it doesn’t get easier overall because now you’re pouring your energy into the next challenge. Each habit unlocks the next level of performance. It’s an endless cycle. ([Location 3092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3092))
- Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday. ([Location 3142](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3142))
- Improvement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about fine-tuning them. ([Location 3157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3157))
- Personally, I employ two primary modes of reflection and review. Each December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the previous year.9 I tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and more.fn2 Then, I reflect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three questions: What went well this year? What didn’t go so well this year? What did I learn? Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity Report. Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Report helps me realize where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use it as a time to revisit my core values and consider whether I have been living in accordance with them. This is when I reflect on my identity and how I can work toward being the type of person I wish to become.fn3 My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions: What are the core values that drive my life and work? How am I living and working with integrity right now? How can I set a higher standard in the future? ([Location 3160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3160))
- Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture. There is too much feedback. Conversely, never reviewing your habits is like never looking in the mirror. You aren’t aware of easily fixable flaws—a spot on your shirt, a bit of food in your teeth. There is too little feedback. Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can see the important changes you should make without losing sight of the bigger picture. You want to view the entire mountain range, not obsess over each peak and valley. Finally, reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most important aspects of behavior change: identity. ([Location 3175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3175))
- The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it. ([Location 3190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3190))
- The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement, but a thousand of them. It’s a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a fundamental unit of the overall system. ([Location 3236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3236))
- This is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no permanent solution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the next bottleneck. Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying. Round and round. Always looking for the next way to get 1 percent better. ([Location 3262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3262))
