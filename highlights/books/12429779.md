## Highlights
- If you believe in God (and I do) you must declare Resistance evil, for it prevents us from achieving the life God intended when He endowed each of us with our own unique genius. Genius is a Latin word; the Romans used it to denote an inner spirit, holy and inviolable, which watches over us, guiding us to our calling. A writer writes with his genius; an artist paints with hers; everyone who creates operates from this sacramental center.

- You know, Hitler wanted to be an artist. At eighteen he took his inheritance, seven hundred kronen, and moved to Vienna to live and study. He applied to the Academy of Fine Arts and later to the School of Architecture. Ever see one of his paintings? Neither have I. Resistance beat him. Call it overstatement but I'll say it anyway: it was easier for Hitler to start World War II than it was for him to face a blank square of canvas.

- Henry Fonda was still throwing up before each stage performance, even when he was seventy-five. In other words, fear doesn't go away. The warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity, which dictates that the battle must be fought anew every day.

- RESISTANCE PLAYS FOR KEEPS Resistance's goal is not to wound or disable. Resistance aims to kill. Its target is the epicenter of our being: our genius, our soul, the unique and priceless gift we were put on earth to give and that no one else has but us. Resistance means business. When we fight it, we are in a war to the death. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=173))
- Remember our rule of thumb: The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it. ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=347))
- Remember, the part of us that we imagine needs healing is not the part we create from; that part is far deeper and stronger. The part we create from can't be touched by anything our parents did, or society did. That part is unsullied, uncorrupted; soundproof, waterproof, and bulletproof. In fact, the more troubles we've got, the better and richer that part becomes. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=394))
- It's one thing to lie to ourselves. It's another thing to believe it. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=440))
- It is one thing to study war and another to live the warrior's life. — Telamon of Arcadia, mercenary of the fifth century B.C. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=457))

- The amateur plays for fun. The professional plays for keeps. To the amateur, the game is his avocation. To the pro it's his vocation. The amateur plays part-time, the professional full-time. The amateur is a weekend warrior. The professional is there seven days a week. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=465))
- One, he doesn't show up every day. Two, he doesn't show up no matter what. Three, he doesn't stay on the job all day. He is not committed over the long haul; the stakes for him are illusory and fake. He does not get money. And he overidentifies with his art. He does not have a sense of humor about failure. You don't hear him bitching, "This fucking trilogy is killing me!" Instead, he doesn't write his trilogy at all. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=534))
- The writer is an infantryman. He knows that progress is measured in yards of dirt extracted from the enemy one day, one hour, one minute at a time and paid for in blood. The artist wears combat boots. He looks in the mirror and sees GI Joe. Remember, the Muse favors working stiffs. She hates prima donnas. To the gods the supreme sin is not rape or murder, but pride. To think of yourself as a mercenary, a gun for hire, implants the proper humility. It purges pride and preciousness. ([Location 564](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=564))
- The professional cannot take rejection personally because to do so reinforces Resistance. Editors are not the enemy; critics are not the enemy. Resistance is the enemy. The battle is inside our own heads. We cannot let external criticism, even if it's true, fortify our internal foe. That foe is strong enough already. A professional schools herself to stand apart from her performance, even as she gives herself to it heart and soul. The Bhagavad-Gita tells us we have a right only to our labor, not to the fruits of our labor. All the warrior can give is his life; all the athlete can do is leave everything on the field. ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=650))
- The professional gives an ear to criticism, seeking to learn and grow. But she never forgets that Resistance is using criticism against her on a far more diabolical level. Resistance enlists criticism to reinforce the fifth column of fear already at work inside the artist's head, seeking to break her will and crack her dedication. The professional does not fall for this. Her resolution, before all others, remains: No matter what, I will never let Resistance beat me. ([Location 659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=659))
- The professional cannot let himself take humiliation personally. Humiliation, like rejection and criticism, is the external reflection of internal Resistance. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=670))
- Before I met Paul, I had never heard of the Muses. He enlightened me. The Muses were nine sisters, daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, which means "memory." Their names are Clio, Erato, Thalia, Terpsichore, Calliope, Polyhymnia, Euterpe, Melpomene, and Urania. Their job is to inspire artists. Each Muse is responsible for a different art. There's a neighborhood in New Orleans where the streets are named after the Muses. I lived there once and had no idea; I thought they were just weird names. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=809))
- I'll take Xenophon at his word; before I sit down to work, I'll take a minute and show respect to this unseen Power who can make or break me. ([Location 855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=855))
- "Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, magic, and power in it. Begin it now." ([Location 882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=882))
- We know that if we embrace our ideals, we must prove worthy of them. And that scares the hell out of us. What will become of us? We will lose our friends and family, who will no longer recognize us. We will wind up alone, in the cold void of starry space, with nothing and no one to hold on to. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=1047))
- You shame the angels who watch over you and you spite the Almighty, who created you and only you with your unique gifts, for the sole purpose of nudging the human race one millimeter farther along its path back to God.
