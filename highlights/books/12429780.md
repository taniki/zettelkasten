## Highlights
- The advice that you “should talk to customers” is well-intentioned, but ultimately a bit unhelpful. It’s like the popular kid advising his nerdy friend to “just be cooler.” You still have to know how to actually do it. ([Location 36](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=36))

- This book is specifically about how to properly talk to customers and learn from them. Talking is one of the big aspects of Customer Development, but shouldn't be confused with the whole process. To keep the distinction clear, I’m going to refer to chatting with people as “customer conversation” (lowercase) instead of “Customer Development” (uppercase). ([Location 61](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=61))
- It’s not anyone else’s responsibility to show us the truth. It’s our responsibility to find it. We do that by asking good questions. ([Location 71](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=71))
- The Mom Test: Talk about their life instead of your idea Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future Talk less and listen more ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=147))
- Here’s the thing: only the market can tell if your idea is good. Everything else is just opinion. Unless you’re talking to a deep industry expert, this is self-indulgent noise with a high risk of false positives. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=162))
- Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so. And how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through what happened the last time X came up. If they haven’t solved the problem, ask why not. Have they tried searching for solutions and found them wanting? Or do they not even care enough to have Googled for it? ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=172))
- The value comes from understanding why they want these features. You don’t want to just collect feature requests. You aren’t building the product by committee. But the motivations and constraints behind those requests are critical. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=184))
- You're shooting blind until you understand their goals. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=193))
- Being walked through their full workflow answers many questions in one fell swoop: how do they spend their days, what tools do they use, and who do they talk to? What are the constraints of their day and life? How does your product fit into that day? Which other tools, products, software, and tasks does your product need to integrate with? ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=207))
- In the abstract, it’s something he would “definitely” pay to solve. Once we got specific, he didn't even care enough to search for a solution (which do exist, incidentally). It’s easy to get someone emotional about a problem if you lead them there. “Don’t you hate when your shoelaces come untied while you’re carrying groceries?” “Yeah, that’s the worst!” And then I go off and design my special never-come-untied laces without realising that if you actually cared, you would already be using a double-knot. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=220))
- "Where does the money come from?" Good question. This isn't something you would necessarily ask a consumer (though you might), but in a B2B context it’s a must-ask. It leads to a conversation about whose budget the purchase will come from and who else within their company holds the power to torpedo the deal. Often, you'll find yourself talking to someone other than the budget owner. Your future pitches will hit unseen snags unless you learn who else matters and what they care about. This knowledge of their purchasing process will eventually turn into a repeatable sales roadmap. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=240))
- "Is there anything else I should have asked?" ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=250))
    - Tags: [[pink]] 
- Rule of thumb: People want to help you. Give them an excuse to do so. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=255))
- There are three types of bad data: Compliments Fluff (generics, hypotheticals, and the future) Ideas ([Location 269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=269))
- With the exception of industry experts who have built very similar businesses, opinions are worthless. You want facts and commitments, not compliments. The best way to escape the misinformation of compliments is to avoid them completely by not mentioning your idea. If they happen anyway, you need to deflect the compliment and get on with the business of gathering facts and commitments. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=279))
- If we’re early in the learning process, the meeting could end here quite happily. We have the learning we came for. If we’re slightly later-stage and already have a product, we might continue by zooming in and pushing for commitments or sales. Remember though: you don’t need to end up with what you wanted to hear in order to have a good conversation. You just need to get to the truth. Here’s a good conversation with a solid negative result. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=316))
- Ignoring compliments should be easy, but it’s not. We crave validation and, as such, are often tricked into registering compliments as reliable data instead of vacuous fibs. Sometimes it’s easier to spot the symptoms than to notice the sneaky compliment itself. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=329))
- Fluff comes in 3 cuddly shapes: Generic claims (“I usually”, “I always”, “I never”) Future-tense promises (“I would”, “I will”) Hypothetical maybes (“I might”, “I could”) ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=339))
- You don’t need to avoid these questions 100% of the time. They aren’t exactly toxic. It’s just that the responses are useless. The mistake is in valuing the answers, not in asking the questions. In fact, sometimes these questions can help you transition into more concrete questioning. ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=352))
- now we’re talking about what actually happens instead of what “usually” happens. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=373))
- While using generics, people describe themselves as who they want to be, not who they actually are. You need to get specific to bring out the edge cases. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=375))
- This is a nice bit of customer insight about their state of mind and circumstances when you’re trying to advertise to them. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=393))
- Them: “I’ll do it next time.” Not a real problem. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=397))
- Long story short, that person is a complainer, not a customer. They’re stuck in the la-la-land of imagining they’re the sort of person who finds clever ways to solve the petty annoyances of their day. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=400))
- There are tons of useful responses you can get. Even learning that the person is a non-customer is useful. To move toward this truth, you just need to reject their generic claims, incidental complaints, and fluffy promises. Instead, anchor them on the life they already lead and the actions they’re already taking. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=413))
- It would be ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=426))
- But they had really just wanted a way to keep their own clients happy. ([Location 450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=450))
- When you hear a request, it’s your job to understand the motivations which led to it. You do that by digging around the question to find the root cause. Why do they bother doing it this way? Why do they want the feature? How are they currently coping without the feature? Dig. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=456))
- “Do you think we should push back the launch to add that feature, or is it something we could add later?” ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=465))
- These nudges don’t need to be complicated. People love talking about their opinions and emotions. Digging into a signal is basically just giving them permission to do a brain dump. ([Location 471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=471))
- Rule of thumb: Ideas and feature requests should be understood, but not obeyed. ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=472))
- Doing it intentionally is fishing for compliments. In other words, you aren’t really looking for contradictory information. You’ve already made up your mind, but need someone’s blessing to take the leap. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=475))
- Accidental approval-seeking is what I call “The Pathos Problem.” It happens when you expose your ego, leading people to feel they ought to protect you by saying nice things. ([Location 479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=479))
- To deal with The Pathos Problem, keep the conversation focused on the other person and ask about specific, concrete cases and examples. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=485))
- Disregard that data and use The Mom Test to re-focus on the person, their life, and their goals. Folks tend not to lie about specific stuff that’s already happened, regardless of your ego. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=487))
- Being pitchy is the dark side of the “seeking approval” coin. Instead of inviting compliments by being vulnerable, you’re demanding them by being annoying. It’s when you hold someone hostage and won’t let them leave until they’ve said they like your idea. Normally, compliments are well-intentioned. In this case, they’re just trying to get you out of their office. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=494))
- Rule of thumb: Anyone will say your idea is great if you’re annoying enough about it. ([Location 507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=507))
- Rule of thumb: The more you’re talking, the worse you’re doing. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=516))
- In addition to ensuring that you aren’t asking trivialities, you also need to search out the world-rocking scary questions you’ve been unintentionally shrinking from. The best way to find them is with thought experiments. Imagine that the company has failed and ask why that happened. Then imagine it as a huge success and ask what had to be true to get there. Find ways to learn about those critical pieces. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=521))
- Every time you talk to someone, you should be asking at least one question which has the potential to destroy your currently imagined business. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=526))
- There’s no easy solution to making yourself face and ask these questions. I once heard the general life advice that, for unpleasant tasks, you should imagine what you would have someone else do if you were delegating it. Then do that. And remember, you’re allowed to ask about money. You're a startup. It's okay. ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=531))
- Learning that your beliefs are wrong is frustrating, but it’s progress. It’s bringing you ever closer to the truth of a real problem and a good market. The worst thing you can do is ignore the bad news while searching for some tiny grain of validation to celebrate. You want the truth, not a gold star. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=546))
- Another way to miss the important questions is by obsessing over ultimately unimportant nuances. We let ourselves get stuck in the details before understanding the big picture. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=563))
- Even if you learn everything there is to know about that particular problem, you still haven’t got a business. ([Location 670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=670))
- Unfortunately, we've missed the elephant, which is that the poorest schools may not have the budgets available to pay us what we need to sustain and grow a business. We're liable to spend a huge amount of time exploring a real and urgent problem, only to hop into the deadpool due to our customer’s budgeting issues. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=676))
- Product risk — Can I build it? Can I grow it? Customer/market risk — Do they want it? Will they pay me? Are there lots of them? ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=712))
- What all this does mean is that if you’ve got heavy product risk (as opposed to pure market risk), then you’re not going to be able to prove as much of your business through conversations alone. The conversations give you a starting point, but you’ll have to start building product earlier and with less certainty than if you had pure market risk. ([Location 731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=731))
- Pre-plan the 3 most important things you want to learn from any given type of person (e.g. customers, investors, industry experts, key hires, etc). Update the list as your questions change. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=734))
- Rule of thumb: You always need a list of your 3 big questions. ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=747))
- In Steve Blank’s original book on Customer Development, 4 Steps to the E.piphany, he solves this by recommending 3 separate meetings: the first about the customer and their problem; the second about your solution; and the third to sell a product. By splitting the meetings, you avoid the premature zoom and Pathos Problem. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=750))
- The Meeting Anti-Pattern is the tendency to relegate every opportunity for customer conversation into a calendar block. Beyond being a bad use of your time and setting expectations that you’re going to show them a product, over-reliance on formal meetings leads us to overlook perfectly good chances for serendipitous learning. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=773))
- If we do it right, they won’t even know we were talking about our idea. ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=783))
- For example, it only takes 5 minutes (maximum) to learn whether a problem exists and is important. A bit further along, you’ll find yourself asking questions which are answered with long stories explaining their workflow, how they spend their time, and what else they’ve tried. You can usually get what you came for in 10-15 minutes, but people love telling stories about themselves, so you can keep this conversation going indefinitely if it’s valuable for you and fun for them. At the extreme end, learning the details of an industry takes an hour or more. Thankfully, those are easier conversations to facilitate since the other person (usually some sort of industry expert) can go into a monologue once you point them in the right direction. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=801))
- That’s successful learning. We disproved our idea before the guy even realised we were talking about it. It took 5 minutes, avoided biases, and didn’t feed us any bad data in the form of compliments, fluff, or ideas. Instead, we got concrete facts about our customers which directly answer our most important questions. ([Location 824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=824))
- Rule of thumb: If you don’t know what happens next after a product or sales meeting, the meeting was pointless. ([Location 868](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=868))
- Commitment can be cash, but doesn’t have to be. Think of it in terms of currency—what are they giving up for you? A compliment costs them nothing, so it’s worth nothing and carries no data. The major currencies are time, reputation risk, and cash. ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=870))
- Just like compliments aren’t data when you’re trying to learn about a problem, they also aren’t progress when you’re trying to validate a product. Hearing a compliment can still be useful though—it’s a warning flag that the person you’re talking to is trying to get rid of you. ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=880))
- Knowing what “ready” means can also give you a better sense of your short-term goals. ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=908))
- The reason Kickstarter is so wonderful is because it forces customers who say they would buy it to actually pull out a credit card and commit. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=920))
- As always, think in terms of currency. What are they giving up to try it out? If your trial is too “cheap”, you can try to increase its cost. For example, you could ask to write a case study about them after they’ve spent 2 weeks using it. Or you could get them to promise to try using it with their team for at least a week. If you’ve got a more developed product, you can take their credit card and just charge them nothing if they cancel within 30 days. The more they are giving up for you, the more seriously you can take their validation. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=926))
- The goal is just to put them to a decision so you can learn whether you’ve found a must-have product and a real customer. ([Location 945](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=945))
- Rule of thumb: In early stage sales, the real goal is learning. Revenue is a side-effect. ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=975))
- If it sounds weird to unexpectedly interview people, then that’s only because you’re thinking of them as interviews instead of conversations. The only thing people love talking about more than themselves is their problems. By taking an interest in the problems and minutia of their day, you’re already more interesting than 99% of the people they’ve ever met. ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=995))
- Rule of thumb: If it’s not a formal meeting, you don’t need to make excuses about why you’re there or even mention that you’re starting a business. Just ask about their life. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=999))
- The practical downside is that no matter how well the chat goes, it’s impossible to transition into a product or sales conversation, since doing so reveals your initial deception and destroys trust. When I open with an excuse, I tend to consider the chat to be a throwaway for one-time learning instead of an ongoing relationship. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1007))
- Joel Gascoigne did a classic landing page test with his startup Buffer, describing the value proposition and collecting emails. But contrary to popular understanding, it wasn’t the metrics or conversion rate which convinced him to move forward. Instead, it was the conversations which resulted from him emailing every single person who signed up and saying hello. ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1021))

- This is starting to bring the customers to you instead of going to them, but still involves sending a mostly cold email. Next, we’ll look at how to run with this principle to make our lives even easier. ([Location 1027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1027))
- Rule of thumb: Kevin Bacon’s 7 degrees of separation applies to customer conversations. You can find anyone you need if you ask for it a couple times. ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1067))
- The framing format I like has five key elements. You’re an entrepreneur trying to solve horrible problem X, usher in wonderful vision Y, or fix stagnant industry Z. Don’t mention your idea. Frame expectations by mentioning what stage you’re at and, if it’s true, that you don’t have anything to sell. Show weakness and give them a chance to help by mentioning the specific problem that you’re looking for answers on. This will also clarify that you’re not a time waster. Put them on a pedestal by showing how much they, in particular, can help. Explicitly ask for help. Or, in shorter form: Vision / Framing / Weakness / Pedestal / Ask ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1101))
- These conversations are easy to screw up. As such, you need to be the one in control. You set the agenda, you keep it on topic, and you propose next steps. Don’t be a jerk about it, but do have a plan for the meeting and be assertive about keeping it on track. ([Location 1137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1137))
- In terms of mindset, don’t go into these discussions looking for customers. It creates a needy vibe and forfeits the position of power. Instead, go in search of industry and customer advisors. You are just trying to find helpful, knowledgable people who are excited about your idea. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1161))
- Willpower is a finite resource. The way to overcome difficult situations isn’t to power through, but rather to change your circumstances to require less willpower. Changing the context of the meeting to “looking for advisors” is the equivalent of throwing out all your chocolate when you start a diet. You change the environment to naturally facilitate your goals. ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1164))
- This isn’t about having a thousand meetings. It’s about quickly learning what you need, and then getting back to building your business. The overall process of learning is never finished, but in most cases you should be able to answer almost any individual question about your business or your customers (and then move onto new ones) within a week. ([Location 1182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1182))
- They say that startups don’t starve, they drown. You never have too few options, too few leads, or too few ideas; you have too many. You get overwhelmed. You do a little bit of everything. When it comes to getting above water and making faster progress, good customer segmentation is your best friend. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1188))
- You get overwhelmed by options and don’t know where to start You aren’t moving forward but can’t prove yourself wrong You receive mixed feedback and can’t make sense of it ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1196))
- This journey sounds obvious when we look at it as a case study. But when we’re in the moment, choosing a really specific customer segment just feels like we’re losing all the other options. And that loss is painful. Remind yourself that you’ll get to the whole world eventually. But you’ve got to start somewhere specific. ([Location 1211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1211))
- Getting specific about your ideal customers allows you to filter out all the noise which comes from everyone else. In our case, we eventually noticed unusually strong signals from creative agencies who wanted to be edgy. We ignored everyone who wasn’t them, cut a bunch of features and were finally able to get a sense of what was working and what wasn’t. ([Location 1225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1225))
- They couldn’t decide which features to build and which to cut. They didn’t know how to improve their marketing language. To make matters worse, the feedback they were getting was wildly inconsistent. If they ran twenty conversations, they ended up with twenty different must-have features and twenty separate must-solve problems. The more people they talked to, the more confused they got. What was going on here? ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1231))
- These guys weren’t having 20 conversations with their customers. They were having one conversation each with 20 different types of customers. That’s why the feedback was so inconsistent. ([Location 1247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1247))
- Rule of thumb: If you aren’t finding consistent problems and goals, you don’t have a specific enough customer segment. ([Location 1253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1253))
- Within this group, which type of person would want it most? Would everyone within this group buy/use it, or only some? Why does that sub-set want it? (e.g. what is their specific problem) Does everyone in the group have that motivation or only some? What additional motivations are there? Which other types of people have these motivations?

- Don’t plan and theorise forever about this stuff. Just spend a few minutes to reach to a concrete initial segment so you can go find a few of them and move the business forward. ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1274))
- You need to do a little bit of work before and after to extract full value. ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1301))
- And that’s a problem because, as we’ve seen, it’s easy to misinterpret what the customer said. ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1305))
- Learning bottlenecks can be created from either end: the founder in touch with customers can do a bad job of sharing it, or the product team can refuse to engage with customers and what they say. ([Location 1313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1313))
- Avoiding bottlenecks has three parts: prepping, reviewing, and taking good notes. ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1317))

- While prepping, if you come across a question which could be answered with desk research, take a moment to do it. You want to move past the obvious stuff and use your in-person conversations to find insights the internet can’t give you. Similarly, if you’re about to meet with a business, do your basic due diligence on LinkedIn and the company website. It takes 5 minutes and will save you from trashing the conversation and looking like an idiot. ([Location 1324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1324))
- I also like to talk about the meta-level of the conversation itself: which questions worked and which didn’t? How can we do better next time? Were there any important signals or questions we missed? This stuff is more craft than science: you have to actively practice it to get better. It’s a valuable skill for your team to have, so it’s worth spending a bit of time improving. ([Location 1341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1341))
- Meetings go best when you’ve got two people at them. One person can focus on taking notes and the other can focus on talking. As the second person, you may notice the lead asking bad questions or missing a signal they should be digging into. Just jump in and fix them. ([Location 1352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1352))
- On the bright side, even though you have to be in the room to process the learning, you don’t necessarily have to be the one setting up or leading the meetings. You can hire people to help as long as you’re there with them, listening. ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1365))

- If it’s totally inappropriate to take notes during the chat, just have the conversation and then immediately retreat to a corner to write down what was said. This is how I usually handle customer conversations at the pub or conferences. ([Location 1420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1420))
- Rule of thumb: Notes are useless if you don’t look at them. ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1423))
- Talking to customers is a tool, not an obligation. If it’s not going to help or you don’t want to do it for whatever reason, just skip it. I’m sure you’ve been on the receiving end of a half-assed survey sent out by some new startup to tick the box marked “learn from customers” on their startup todo list. There are better ways to waste your time. Without figuring out what actually matters to your company and how to deal with it effectively, you’re just going through the motions.

- The process before a batch of conversations: If you haven’t yet, choose a focused, findable segment With your team, decide your big 3 learning goals If relevant, decide on ideal next steps and commitments If conversations are the right tool, figure out who to talk to Create a series of best guesses about what the person cares about If a question could be answered via desk research, do that first ([Location 1436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1436))
- The goal of this process is twofold. First, to ensure you’re spending your time well by attacking the questions which really matter and making use of the brains of the whole founding team. Second, to spread any new learning through your team as quickly and completely as possible. ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1445))
- Customer learning can move really quickly when you’re doing it right. This book isn’t meant to give you an excuse to squander precious months theorising and planning the “perfect question”. It’s meant to help you extract maximum value in minimum time so you can get back to what really matters: building your business.
