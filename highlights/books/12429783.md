## Highlights
- This psychic life is seen as so precious and so delicate that it will wither if exposed to the harsh realities of the social world, and will flower only to the extent that it is protected and isolated. Each person’s self has become his principal burden; to know oneself has become an end, instead of a means through which one knows the world.

- Anxiety about what one feels might also be seen as the spread, and the vulgarization, of the Romantic “quest for personality.” Such a quest has not been conducted in a social vacuum; it is the conditions of ordinary life which have propelled people into this Romantic search for self-realization. Further, it has been beyond the scope of literary studies of this quest to weigh up the costs to society which result, and these costs are great.

- I have tried to create a theory of expression in public by a process of interplay between history and theory. Concrete changes in public behavior, speech, dress, and belief are used in this book as evidence for making a theory about what expression is in society. As the history has suggested clues to a theory, I have tried to take the abstract insights gained as clues in their turn for new questions to ask the historical record.

- The world of intimate feeling loses any boundaries; it is no longer restrained by a public world in which people make alternative and countervailing investment of themselves. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002RI9AFE&location=411))
- Sexuality is not an action but a state of being, in which the physical act of love follows almost as a passive consequence, a natural result, of people feeling intimate with each other. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002RI9AFE&location=417))
- In rebelling against sexual repression, we have rebelled against the idea that sexuality has a social dimension. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002RI9AFE&location=441))
- The 19th Century is not yet over. ([Location 862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002RI9AFE&location=862))
