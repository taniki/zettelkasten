## Highlights
- “We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one.” “Come on and we’ll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one.” “You wouldn’t walk across the street.” “Not if I could help it.” We went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi. “Well,” I said, “we’re out away from them.” We stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each other. The waiter came and said the taxi was outside. Brett pressed my hand hard. I gave the waiter a franc and we went out. “Where should I tell him?” I asked. “Oh, tell him to drive around.” I told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris, and got in, and slammed the door. Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed. I sat beside her. The cab started with a jerk. “Oh, darling, I’ve been so miserable,” Brett said.

- At five o’clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters. They were not very good letters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them. Brett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar and had a Jack Rose with George the barman. Brett had not been in the bar either, and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took a taxi to the Café Select. Crossing the Seine I saw a string of barges being towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the sweeps as they came toward the bridge. The river looked nice. It was always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0V3E&location=675))
- Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on. ([Location 2627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0V3E&location=2627))
- The English talked with inflected phrases. One phrase to mean everything. ([Location 2644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0V3E&location=2644))
- The fiesta was really started. It kept up day and night for seven days. The dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on. The things that happened could only have happened during a fiesta. Everything became quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have any consequences. It seemed out of place to think of consequences during the fiesta. All during the fiesta you had the feeling, even when it was quiet, that you had to shout any remark to make it heard. It was the same feeling about any action. It was a fiesta and it went on for seven days. ([Location 2715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000FC0V3E&location=2715))
