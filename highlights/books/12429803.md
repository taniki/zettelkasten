## Highlights
- At this point, I was reading a ton of books on topics like thinking and strategy. But the more I read and thought about it, the more I felt that studying more will only make your strategy and reasoning the same as everyone else's. Reading gradually felt less and less useful, so I turned to more important things.
- If only Dad had given me more guidance, maybe I wouldn't have wound up in such a miserable state. If only he'd taught me about the ways of life. If only I had listened and picked a better life... My thoughts were a pathetic bundle of“what ifs”and“if onlys.”
  I never held a real grudge against my father; I just wanted someone else to blame for never having studied and now having no prospects. I felt like I had let all my opportunities pass me by.
- While they never actually said so, I'm sure my parents had always wanted more from their son. I never got into trouble, but surely they wished I would pick a more wholesome career and better contribute to society. So when I started talking about elder care, I'm sure they were elated. It was connected to their work, so they could even offer advice as needed.
  They probably doubted I'd stick with it, but they were supportive and encouraged me to give it a shot. I was known for my impetuous decisions, and this was no exception. My parents always forgave me my impulsiveness.
- I was taking the easy path.
- I used to think that games were all I had, but my thinking has since changed. Games triggered my personal growth, and for that I am grateful and intend to continue playing for as long as I can stay competitive. However, I'm no longer as fixated as I once was. When the day comes that I lose my edge and I don't notice myself growing any further, I'll give up gaming with no regrets. I love games more than anything, but I don't need them like I once did.
- While I always envied the grand dreams of others, I never found my own. I thus have no intentions of telling you to dream big, or demanding that you dream at all.
- Sure, certain awards may have more value in other fields. Nevertheless, no matter how great the award, it's easy to question whether winning equates to success if you can't repeat it the following year.
  Forget all that. Live life at your own pace and grow every day, and the accolades will naturally follow. That is a much more reasonable and sustainable lifestyle.
- It's a shame I had to learn my lesson in a national tournament, but it's a valuable one nonetheless─that trying your hardest doesn't guarantee victory, and that there are positive and negative ways to apply effort.
- The wrong kind of effort also leads to obsession. It warps your mind, making you think that hard work alone is deserving of success.
- Simply building experience without thinking about what you're doing is not effort. Actually, since thinking is the hard part, in a sense you're taking the easy way out. Cutting out the thinking is just aimless flailing.
- To keep your effort at sustainable levels, don't confuse short-term objectives with your long-term goals.
- Tournaments are a playground for people who practice for growth. It's where they show off their achievements. Once I made that realization, I finally started making continued growth my goal, rather than winning. Games enrich my life by allowing me to grow as an individual, and that's what motivates me to keep on going.
- Objectives can be a good short-term motivation that draws out your potential. Get overly obsessed with that objective and let it become your goal, however, and you'll stop producing and lose the will to continue.
- Your strength is the same whether you enter a tournament or not.
- Fighting games are as much a mental battle as anything, and players who are too hung up on winning are easy to read and tend to shy away at the last minute. They tend to be more cautious and overly rely on theory. Theory is a good foundation, but not enough to win. Playing that way makes you look like you're riding with training wheels.
- When setting the right amount for myself, I aim for a level of effort I can sustain for ten years. Ten years is just right─not too soft, not too hard. Think of it that way, and your capacity for effort should naturally come into focus.
- While I certainly don't get the same thrill out of it as I did in my youth, I do my best to hit the arcade every day. On evenings when I don't have an interview or meeting, or have to play someone online, I head out to my favorite arcade in Shinjuku. Some days it feels like a chore, but I do enjoy myself once I get there.
  I've made arcade visits compulsory. Even as a pro, it's not like I have any regularly-scheduled matches or anything, so I have to make it compulsory or else I would just skip anytime I feel like it. I'm confident that I could skip going to the arcade for a year or so and still be competitive, but that's no excuse to slack off.
- Too many people feel like working hard is just about putting in the hours, but working past your own limits is not going to produce any results. Whether it be six hours a day or three, it's better to determine the maximum sustainable amount of time that you can stay focused. Outside of that, have faith in your plan and rest.
- Daily effort and acknowledging your improvements makes life a pleasure. For me, this is far more satisfying than working for some nebulous future happiness. Even without any days off, daily life can be a joy beyond words.
- The main thing is to walk the hard road of self-development through constant change, but there are plenty of elements that go into this, and many pitfalls and sidetracks along the way. Without adding up these factors and putting in the work, you won't be able to win consistently.
- The first major hurdle to overcome is any tendency to slack off and rely on natural talent for a particular game. Even if a game clicks with you, continued success isn't guaranteed without work. Until you realize that staying strong at a game takes a combination of many elements, you'll continue leaving things up to chance.
- Another hurdle to overcome in fighting games is age. Those outside Japan seem particularly sensitive about how the reflexes decline with time and are amazed at how I'm still playing at my age. Along the way to becoming world champion again at twenty-eight, I spoke briefly with one of the players I defeated when we shook hands. He told me that he had been ready to hang it up, but that I had inspired him to continue by remaining one of the world's best for ten years running. He didn't seem that old to me, but opinion abroad seems to be that reflexes peak at twenty-two or twenty-three. To me, this sounds suspiciously like using age as an excuse when the real issue is a lack of effort─their effort levels, not their reflexes, have fallen off with time. If you focus on learning and applying new tactics and strategy instead of relying on speed and fast reflexes, age isn't scary in the slightest.
- Personally, I always remind myself that both my opponent and I are human; nothing is special about either of us. My victories are due to a conventional combination of knowledge, technical accuracy, experience, and practice, not because I overwhelmed my opponent with my greatness. Win or lose, one of us did what needed to be done, and as a result beat the other. Never forget that in any contest, one side continued to do a perfectly normal thing, and as a result was able to win this one time.
- When something bothers me, I always make a note of it, usually on my phone. I never have the time to do anything about it at the time, so I resolve to sort it out later. I create itemized lists to make review easier. If I ever find myself thinking it's not worth the effort, I remind myself never to second-guess my intuition and pull out my phone. If you don't capture it when it hits you, it can be hard to recall what exactly the problem was. Noting the problem immediately allows you to deal with the issue even after time has passed.
- To stay on top, you need to think long and hard on each individual issue. You must discard preconceived notions and investigate the cause of issues from every perspective and angle. When you hit a wall, the way forward will come to you given enough time. Just push the issue to the back of your mind and let your subconscious work on it. Quite often, a hint will fall into your lap from a totally unrelated place. Perhaps a casual utterance when talking to a friend will wind up being the best piece of advice.
- Make a habit of thinking deeply about issues, and eventually you'll find yourself able to probe questions more deeply than the average person can.
- Many believe that change and progress are different things. But in the gaming world at least, there is no growth without change. Never being the same person as I was the day before is how I grow.
- To grow is to advance and avoid getting stuck. Keep developing and you can keep winning. It doesn't matter how old you are, or if a new game comes out, or if there are more skilled players.
- Small changes to fighting game tactics will take about a week to perfect, and bigger changes will take about three months. Tactical changes significant enough for others to notice will depend on the opponent, so they require further tweaking to adjust for opponent play while still perfecting the change. Such changes are more of a challenge and thus take at least two or three months to integrate effectively.
- To stay on top of your game, you have to be prepared for the fact that at the end of one cycle of change awaits an even harder cycle.
- Probably because I've been observing people in competition since I was a kid, I would say that I'm adept at looking at a person and telling whether we'd get along or not. Past experience has shown that if I don't get along with a person, I probably won't like their play style either. Conversely, if someone's play impresses me, I usually find that we get along well. Maybe compatibility on the personal level and the game level are interconnected.
  For that exact reason, though, I say go out of your way to play against those you dislike and overcome your feelings. If you only surround yourself with those you like and agree with, it'll of course be comfortable for you, but you won't overcome your preconceptions and get any stronger. It is by actively working with those we dislike and confronting our weaknesses that we are first able to shed our skin and make real strides in growth.
- That seems to me like a boring way to go through life. You can't grow that way. If you want to talk to someone or challenge the World Champion, do it. Maybe you'll be ignored, maybe you'll be embarrassed when you get slammed in your match, but that's not the end of the world. It'll hardly affect your life at all, in fact.
  Much worse is to be paralyzed by fear of failure. Society tends to evaluate us based solely on visible results. At times, I even sense an air of intolerance toward failure. No one wants to be branded as a failure. We hear adults belittle kids, saying they have no talent and so should give up and face reality, or that they'll fail no matter what, so they might as well not even try. Who wouldn't second-guess themselves if told something like that?
- I have worked hard to understand the true essence of the game without relying on easy moves. This gives me a steadier, more dependable power level.
- I envy those who have never had to choose the hard road. I understand that there are those who are perfectly fine with their current situation, as well as those unable to change their current lot even if they wanted. If you have strong friendships, a job that you like, and feel fulfilled with your daily life, maybe you've never been faced with that choice. I've never been so lucky. It took enormous effort to get any recognition for my life choices. Drastic measures were the only way for me to build up any confidence.
- Personal growth is about figuring things out and gaining experience, not hoarding knowledge. An attitude that promotes discovering the new and the valuable is far more important. Thus, your tactics and strategy should always be changing and evolving. Adopt fresh tactics regularly to replace your old ones. Today is more important than yesterday.
- The ability to make new discoveries is far more important than the techniques discovered.
- I don't like attacking my opponents' weaknesses; it's a crude way to win.
- While helpful, it's never good to overly rely on conventional wisdom, as it isn't absolute. If you do and fall into a slump, it can be hard to pull yourself out of it with common wisdom alone.
- To me, a good indicator of your progression is whether you are letting fear dictate your actions. If you ever sense that you've hit a standstill and stopped growing, or there's no change in your play style, that's a sign that you need to take immediate measures to change. You don't always need to make big changes; there's nothing wrong with small discoveries and growing little by little.
- To me, facing an undefeatable opponent is the epitome of happiness. It's tough, of course, and you won't see me grinning through the match, but the resulting self-growth is worth it.
- In the past two or three years, I've reached the point where I now see that praise and results are just side effects of the process; my own efforts are far more valuable. I realize now that I used to agonize over whether I was right or wrong because I lacked confidence. It took me pressing forward, strong-willed and without being discouraged, to become satisfied with my life choices, right or not.
- Being self-conscious about something makes you seriously consider whether you should just quit. But as long as you're not bothering anyone, there's no reason to stop if that something is really important to you. I've heard stories of others who get embarrassed if anyone sees them practicing their sport or hobby, or even studying, and so do it in secret. To me, they should be proud of their effort, not hide it.
- Unless you're constantly exposed to intense competition, your ability to keep winning will deteriorate.
- Conversely, even an amateur can understand what makes a ten strong. They can see how using a particular special move, or repeating a certain combo, or perfecting a certain guard makes someone stronger. That kind of strength can be put into words and analyzed.
  The ultimate strength, however, is strong in a way they can't even fathom. It can't be put into words, and no one can analyze it. Only those who have attained that level of strength know its secret. Therein lies the godlike strength that inspires the masses and makes the crowd go wild.
- If I can't become stronger tomorrow than I am today, I don't see the point in even trying. If I'm not continuously growing, I might as well stop competing altogether.
- Become complacent and you stop growing. It'll also lower your peers' image of you. It would bother me if others thought I'm slacking off after winning a championship. Like everyone, I am pleased with myself immediately after a big win, but I fight my urge to slack off and instead keep my celebrations short. I realize that such joys are fleeting. You can't grow while you're basking in victory.
- Going to the arcade proves to me that even champions don't win every match. Staying on top and continuing to grow is far harder and more valuable than becoming champion. Once you realize that, you'll stay grounded enough to get out there and challenge others the next day.
- To me, continual improvement through facing challenges is what it means to be alive. Abandoning growth for momentum isn't my idea of a stimulating life, much less an enjoyable one.
  Always challenge yourself and make mistakes. Sure, you'll experience lows at times, but you can always recover, especially when you're young. Your energy and strength in youth ensures that you'll get back on your feet. Not that getting older means you can't make mistakes. The point is not to only make mistakes while you're young, but rather to start making them then.
- Our responsibilities increase with age, and with more responsibility comes concerns that we're one bad mistake away from losing it all. Fear of failure grows from such concerns. Get in the habit of making misjudgments early on, however, and the process of trial and error becomes second nature. It ceases to bother you so much.
- I've made countless errors in the past. Having climbed almost every step on the staircase of gaming, I've made plenty of missteps that led me away from success. Anytime you notice a misstep, however, just backtrack a step or two and climb in a different direction. The worst thing you can do is stand still, overanalyzing which way to proceed instead of picking a direction and heading that way. You'll advance far more quickly by just climbing, even toward another mistake.
- Part of my motivation for writing this book was to share my methods for finding your own way to win, even when luck isn't on your side.
- If I'm going to die someday anyway, I want it to be on the battlefield. I'm not the type to take my last breath quietly, holed up in my castle. Just as these warlord generals defied death, I too continue to fight on the front lines of gaming today.
- My plans are to keep up my childish lifestyle as long as I can and give my best effort, one year at a time.
