## Highlights
- Don't make your slides so intricate and clever that people can't read them. Do not design for seventeen-year-olds with perfect eyesight sitting right next to the screen. Think about regular people who might have eyesight problems and might be sitting at the back.
  Dead big type. Never have more than three bullet points per slide and never have more than six words per line. Start with that. (Page 177)
- You've got three main sections to your presentation. Make sure there's something concrete in each. We remember concrete things, not abstractions. People, objects, places. Or things happening to people, objects or places. (Page 197)
- And it doesn't have to be exactly you. You probably have an Instagram you. The you with a little more polish, whose knick-knacks are a little more elegantly arranged. Do that, but for PowerPoint. Summon up a PowerPoint persona who's the same you but with a little more energy and oomph. Swing your arms round your head for thirty seconds before you start, to get your energy up. Be slightly louder and brighter than you ordinarily would. That's all you need. (Page 207)
- If you do it right, that's all a presentation is.
  You talking to people about some slides you've made or collected. These are things you know a lot about. (Page 209)
- Get them to clap. And then I bow a little (it's probably more of shrug), put a big THANK YOU on the screen, say, "That's it,' and get them to clap. This is surprisingly easy to do - people are predisposed to follow clapping cues. And I think it makes a difference. It's a well-known psychological fact that we do not decide to do things and then do them. We do things and then our unconscious mind tricks us into thinking that's what we'd been planning all along.We are not the drivers of our bodies - we are the passengers.
  If people clap a lot then that makes them think they've enjoyed something. So get them to clap.
  If you're introducing guest speakers get them clapped on as well as off. Americans do this spontaneously; other nations, not so much. And get an audience to clap themselves every now and then. For guessing the answer to something. Or just for sitting there for twenty minutes. You can even tell them why you're doing it. Knowledge of this manipulation doesn't appear to reduce its efficacy.
