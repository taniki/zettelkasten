## Highlights
- We write when we need to remember something, be it an idea, a quote or the outcome of a study. We write when we want to organise our thoughts and when we want to exchange ideas with others. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=114))
- This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way. ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=130))
- There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly. But without an immediate experience of failure, there is also not much demand for help. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=139))
- The right question is: What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best possible position to write a great paper easily? ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=149))
- That is why good, productive writing is based on good note-taking. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=155))

- To sum it up: The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic. But if that is true (and I wholeheartedly believe it is), and the key to successful writing lies in the preparation, it also means that the vast majority of self-help books and study guides can only help you to close the barn door correctly and according to official rules – not just a moment, but many months after the horse has already escaped. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=158))
- We know today that self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed. Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=176))

- A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=191))

- Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=201))
- The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery – or insight. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=208))

- Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as they focus on what they haven’t learned and mastered yet. This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are (Clance and Imes 1978; Brems et al. 1994). ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=235))
- The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. There is quite extensive empirical and logical research on this phenomenon (for an overview: cf. Sull and Eisenhardt, 2015). Taking smart notes is as simple as it gets. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=251))
- There is really no need to reorganise anything you already have. Just deal with things differently the moment you have to deal with them anyway. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=257))
- The new way of working might feel artificial at first and not necessarily like what you intuitively would do. That is normal. But as soon as you get used to taking smart notes, it will feel so much more natural that you will wonder how you were ever able to get anything done before. Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly (cf. Mata, Todd, and Lippke, 2010). ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=267))
- The principle is simple but holistic. It is not a quick fix or a fancy tool. It doesn’t do the work for you. But it does provide a structure for our everyday work that deals with the fact that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=279))
- What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent. Even the best tools won’t make much of a difference if they are used in isolation. Only if they are embedded in a well-conceived working process can the tools play out their strengths. There is no point in having great tools if they don’t fit together. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=295))
- Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=302))
- The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. And to stay in control, it's better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=374))
- Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998). ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=381))
- Sure, you need to be smart to be successful in academia and writing, but if you don’t have an external system to think in and organise your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just can’t be compensated by a high IQ. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=389))
- It is only in hindsight that the scale of the advantages of this small tweak became obvious to everyone. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=408))
- Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them. Adding a note directly behind another note is only one way of doing this. Another way is by adding a link on this and/or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system. This very much resembles, of course, the way we use hyperlinks on the internet. But, as I will explain later, they are quite different and it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper. The similarities are obviously there, but the subtle differences are what makes this system unique. ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=441))
- We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=457))
- At this point, it should become clear that you don’t need to wait for a genie to appear, as each step is clearly not only within your abilities, but also straightforward and well defined: Assemble notes and bring them into order, turn these notes into a draft, review it and you are done. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=484))
- it. Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. Notes build up while you think, read, understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think, read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway. If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=494))
- Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place – your reference system. ([Location 519](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=519))
- The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=523))
- Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=525))
- Read more to challenge and strengthen your arguments and change and develop your arguments according to the new information you are learning about. ([Location 540](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=540))
- Don’t cling to an idea if another, more promising one gains momentum. The more you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect and the more likely it is that you will generate questions from it. It might be exactly what you were interested in from the beginning, but it is more likely that your interests will have changed – that is what insight does. ([Location 544](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=544))
- We cannot help but think about more than one question at a time and the chances are that you will think and write in the future as well. It might not be for academia or a publication, but certainly for your own intellectual growth. Gather what you encounter along your way and don’t let any good idea go to waste. You might read a certain book in hope it could be useful for one of the papers you write. Maybe you are wrong, but it still might contain some interesting thoughts worth keeping and useful for something else you haven’t thought about yet. ([Location 561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=561))
- Spending the little extra time to add them to your system will make all the difference, because the accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn. ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=578))
- Most people follow different lines of thought at the same time. They might focus for a while on one idea, but then leave it alone for another while until they see how to proceed further. It is helpful then to be able to pick up on another idea now and go back to the earlier thought later. It is much more realistic to keep this flexibility and you don’t have to worry about starting all over. ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=583))
- As nothing really fits together, working within this arrangement becomes extremely complicated indeed and difficult to get anything done. ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=604))
- The reference system has two purposes: To collect the references (duh) and the notes you take during your reading. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=636))
- If you have pen and paper, an editor, your slip-box and reference system at hand, you are ready to go. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=658))
- By writing, students demonstrate what they have learned, show their ability to think critically and ability to develop ideas. This understanding is related to the idea that students prepare for independent research. In this mindset, the writing of a paper is just another skill to be learned. ([Location 691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=691))
- Studying, done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot be anticipated and will be shared within the scientific community under public scrutiny. ([Location 704](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=704))
- There is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=706))

- School is different. Pupils are usually not encouraged to follow their own learning paths, question and discuss everything the teacher is teaching and move on to another topic if something does not promise to generate interesting insight. The teacher is there for the pupils to learn. But, as Wilhelm von Humboldt, founder of the Humboldt University of Berlin and brother to the great explorer Alexander von Humboldt, put it, the professor is not there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And truth is always a public matter. Everything within the university aims at some kind of publication. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=708))
- The moment the author can be removed from the scene, the written piece is a public claim on truth. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=716))
- If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing. ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=719))
- Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=727))
- you will try to learn as efficiently as possible so you can quickly get to the point where actual open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about. ([Location 730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=730))
- You will read in a more engaged way, because you cannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don’t understand what it is about. By doing this, you will elaborate on the meaning, which will make it much more likely that you will remember it. You also have to think beyond the things you read, because you need to turn it into something new. And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=734))

- Anders Ericsson, 2008). ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=737))
- In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=787))
- The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=797))
- To achieve a critical mass, it is crucial to distinguish clearly between three types of notes: 1.  Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way and will end up in the trash within a day or two. 2.  Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either in the reference system or, written as if for print, in the slip-box. 3.  Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=802))
- But most importantly, without a permanent reservoir of ideas, you will not be able to develop any major ideas over a longer period of time because you are restricting yourself either to the length of a single project or the capacity of your memory. Exceptional ideas need much more than that. ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=827))
- What all these category-confusing approaches have in common is that the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep. More notes will make it more difficult to retrieve the right ones and bring related ones together in a playful way. But it should be just the opposite: The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones – and the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=833))
- If you already know that you will not go back to them, don’t take these kind of notes in the first place. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=843))
- Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=844))
- Most ideas will not stand the test of time, while others might become the seed for a major project. ([Location 849](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=849))
- A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal. In the first case, you forgot what it was supposed to remind you of. In the second case, you forgot the context that gave it its meaning. ([Location 851](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=851))

- The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference. ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=866))
- Only because every note is in the same format at the same place can they later be combined and assembled into something new and no thought is ever wasted on the question of where to put or label it. ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=870))
- Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=922))
- We will not be guided by a blindly made-up plan picked from our unreliable brains, but by our interest, curiosity and intuition, which is formed and informed by the actual work of reading, thinking, discussing, writing and developing ideas – and is something that continuously grows and reflects our knowledge and understanding externally. ([Location 930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=930))
- Taking smart notes is the precondition to break with the linear order. There is one reliable sign if you managed to structure your workflow according to the fact that writing is not a linear process, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about. ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=953))
- If you on the other hand develop your thinking in writing, open questions will become clearly visible and give you an abundance of possible topics to elaborate further in writing. ([Location 957](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=957))
- The material will cluster around the questions they returned to most often, so they don’t risk too far of a departure from their interest. If your first chosen topic turns out to be not as interesting, you will just move on and your notes will cluster around something else. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=971))
- Sometimes we feel like our work is draining our energy and we can only move forward if we put more and more energy into it. But sometimes it is the opposite. Once we get into the workflow, it is as if the work itself gains momentum, pulling us along and sometimes even energizing us. This is the kind of dynamic we are looking for. ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=988))
- Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward (DePasque and Tricomi, 2015). ([Location 997](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=997))
- The only thing that matters is that they discover something that gives them a good experience that they would like to have again. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1002))
- Feedback loops are not only crucial for the dynamics of motivation, but also the key element to any learning process. Nothing motivates us more than the experience of becoming better at what we do. And the only chance to improve in something is getting timely and concrete feedback. Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn, or in the more general terms of psychologist Carol Dweck, to grow. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1007))
- Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding). ([Location 1016](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1016))
- To seek as many opportunities to learn as possible is the most reliable long-term growth strategy. And if growth and success are not reasons enough, then maybe the fact that the fear of failure has the ugliest name of all phobias: Kakorrhaphiophobia. ([Location 1019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1019))
- Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. It is the simplest test: We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words. By doing this, we not only get a better sense of our ability to understand, but also increase our ability to clearly and concisely express our understanding – which in return helps to grasp ideas more quickly. If we try to fool ourselves here and write down incomprehensible words, we will detect it in the next step when we try to turn our literature notes into permanent notes and try to connect them with others. ([Location 1031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1031))
- The slip-box is not a collection of notes. Working with it is less about retrieving specific notes and more about being pointed to relevant facts and generating insight by letting ideas mingle. Its usability grows with its size, not just linearly but exponentially. When we turn to the slip-box, its inner connectedness will not just provide us with isolated facts, but with lines of developed thoughts. ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1048))
- Yes, our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age. But if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or “latticework of mental models” (Munger, 1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information. That makes it easier not only to learn and remember, but also to retrieve the information later in the moment and context it is needed. ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1056))

- It is not the slip-box or our brains alone, but the dynamic between them that makes working with it so productive. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1063))
- The fact that people nevertheless believe that they can get better at it and increase their productivity can easily be explained by two factors. The first is the lack of a control group or an objective external measurement that would provide us with the feedback we need to learn. The second is what psychologists call the mere-exposure effect: doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it – completely independent of our actual performance (Bornstein 1989). We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill. ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1105))
- Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. It also means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting. All these are not just different tasks, but tasks requiring a different kind of attention. It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1113))
- If we proofread a manuscript and don’t manage to get enough distance from ourselves as authors, we will only see our thoughts, not the actual text. ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1146))
- Don’t make plans. Become an expert. ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1195))
- There is no universal rule that could tell one upfront at which stage it wouldn’t make sense to follow up on an idea, a possible contradiction or a footnote. ([Location 1216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1216))
- To be able to become an expert, we need the freedom to make our own decisions and all the necessary mistakes that help us learn. Like bicycling, it can only be learned by doing it. ([Location 1217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1217))

- The workflow around the slip-box is not a prescription that tells you what to do at what stage of writing. On the contrary: It gives you a structure of clearly separable tasks, which can be completed within reasonable time and provides you with instant feedback through interconnected writing tasks.

- Conversely, we can use the Zeigarnik effect to our advantage by deliberately keeping unanswered questions in our mind.

- How extensive the literature notes should be really depends on the text and what we need it for. It also depends on our ability to be concise, the complexity of the text and how difficult it is to understand. As literature notes are also a tool for understanding and grasping the text, more elaborate notes make sense in more challenging cases, while in easier cases it might be sufficient to just jot down some keywords.

- The slip-box forces us to be selective in reading and note-taking, but the only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box. The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections. Everything can contribute to the development of thoughts within the slip-box: an addition as well as a contradiction, the questioning of a seemingly obvious idea as well as the differentiation of an argument. What we are looking for are facts and information that can add something and therefore enrich the slip-box. One of the most important habitual changes when starting to work with the slip-box is moving the attention from the individual project with our preconceived ideas towards the open connections within the slip-box. ([Location 1502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1502))
- The slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers relevant notes.

- Reading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text. Rereading is especially dangerous because of the mere-exposure effect: The moment we become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it.

- Understanding is not just a precondition to learning something. To a certain degree, learning is understanding. And the mechanisms are not so different, either: We can only improve our learning if we test ourselves on our progress.

- There is a clear division of labour between the brain and the slip-box: The slip-box takes care of details and references and is a long-term memory resource that keeps information objectively unaltered.

- We don’t just play with ideas in our heads, but do something with them in a very concrete way: We think about what they mean for other lines of thoughts, then we write this explicitly on paper and connect them literally with the other notes.

- In contrast to manuscript pages per day, a certain number of notes a day is a reasonable goal for academic writing.

- The brain also doesn’t store information neurally and objectively. We reinvent and rewrite our memory every time we try to retrieve information. The brain works with rules of thumb and makes things look as if they fit, even if they don’t. It remembers events that never happened, connects unrelated episodes to convincing narratives and completes incomplete images. It cannot help but see patterns and meaning everywhere, even in the most random things (cf. Byrne, 2008). ([Location 1745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1745))

- By explicitly writing down how something connects or leads to something else, we force ourselves to clarify and distinguish ideas from each other. ([Location 1807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1807))
- Transferring these ideas into the network of our own thoughts, our latticework of theories, concepts and mental models in the slip-box brings our thinking to the next level. Now we elaborate these ideas within different contexts and connect them with other ideas in a durable fashion. The literature notes are going to be archived, which means the ideas would be lost in the reference system if we didn’t do something with them. That is why we transfer them into our external memory, the slip-box, with which we have an ongoing dialogue and where they can become part of our active set of ideas.

- From the standpoint of evolution, it makes sense that our brains have a built-in preference to learn meaningful information and a disregard for meaningless letter combinations. But Ebbinghaus laid the foundation for a long-lasting and influential tradition of learning theories that separates understanding from learning.

- Memory techniques are the fix for a rather artificial situation. When it comes to academic writing, we don't have the need for this trick, as we can choose to build and think exclusively within meaningful contexts. Abstract information like bibliographic references can be stored externally – there is no benefit in knowing them by heart. Everything else better bear meaning. ([Location 1907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1907))
- The challenge of writing as well as learning is therefore not so much to learn, but to understand, as we will already have learned what we understand. The problem is that the meaning of something is not always obvious and needs to be explored. That is why we need to elaborate on it. But elaboration is nothing more than connecting information to other information in a meaningful way. The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means for other contexts as well. ([Location 1911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1911))
- Learned right, which means understanding, which means connecting in a meaningful way to previous knowledge, information almost cannot be forgotten anymore and will be reliably retrieved if triggered by the right cues. Moreover, this new learned knowledge can provide more possible connections for new information. If you focus your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn. But if you focus your time and energy on learning without trying to understand, you will not only not understand, but also probably not learn. And the effects are cumulative. ([Location 1928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1928))
- Writing notes and sorting them into the slip-box is nothing other than an attempt to understand the wider meaning of something. The slip-box forces us to ask numerous elaborating questions: What does it mean? How does it connect to … ? What is the difference between … ? What is it similar to? That the slip-box is not sorted by topics is the precondition for actively building connections between notes. Connections can be made between heterogeneous notes – as long as the connection makes sense. This is the best antidote to the impeding way most information is given to us in our learning institutions. Most often, it comes in modular form, sorted by topic, separated by disciplines and generally isolated from other information. The slip-box is forcing us to do the exact opposite: To elaborate, to understand, to connect and therefore to learn seriously. ([Location 1939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1939))
- As the slip-box is not a book with just one topic, we don’t need to have an overview of it. On the contrary, we are much better off accepting as early as possible that an overview of the slip-box is as impossible as having an overview of our own thinking while we are thinking. As an extension of our own memory, the slip-box is the medium we think in, not something we think about. The note sequences are the clusters where order emerges from complexity. We extract information from different linear sources and mix it all up and shake it until new patterns emerge. Then, we form these patterns into new linear texts. ([Location 1993](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1993))
- Because it should not be used as an archive, where we just take out what we put in, but as a system to think with, the references between the notes are much more important than the references from the index to a single note. Focusing exclusively on the index would basically mean that we always know upfront what we are looking for – we would have to have a fully developed plan in our heads. But liberating our brains from the task of organizing the notes is the main reason we use the slip-box in the first place. ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2003))
- The organisation of the notes is in the network of references in the slip-box, so all we need from the index are entry points. ([Location 2010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2010))
- We can provide ourselves with a (temporarily valid) overview over a topic or subtopic just by making another note. ([Location 2017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2017))
- This is important: Every consideration on the structure of a topic is just another consideration on a note – bound to change and dependent on the development of our understanding. ([Location 2020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2020))

- Assigning keywords is much more than just a bureaucratic act. It is a crucial part of the thinking process, which often leads to a deeper elaboration of the note itself and the connection to other notes. ([Location 2053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2053))
- It is important to always keep in mind that making these links is not a chore, a kind of file-box maintenance. The search for meaningful connections is a crucial part of the thinking process towards the finished manuscript. But here, it is dealt with in a very concrete way. Instead of figuratively searching our internal memory, we literally go through the file-box and look for connections. By dealing with actual notes, we are also less prone to imagine connections where there aren’t any, as we can see in black and white if something makes sense or not. ([Location 2099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2099))
- If we forget about an idea and have it again, our brains get as excited as if we are having it the first time. Therefore, working with the slip-box is disillusioning, but at the same time it increases the chance that we actually move forward in our thinking towards uncharted territory, instead of just feeling like we are moving forward. ([Location 2114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2114))
- It is much easier to see differences and similarities than to detect them by mere thinking. ([Location 2125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2125))
- The constant comparing of notes also serves as an ongoing examination of old notes in a new light. I am surprised how often the addition of one note leads to a correction, a complementation or an improvement of old ideas. Sometimes, we discover that the source given in a text is not the actual source. Sometimes, we discover that the interpretation of a study conflicts with another interpretation, making us realise that the study is so vague that it can be used as proof for two contradicting interpretations. ([Location 2132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2132))
- The slip-box not only confronts us with dis-confirming information, but also helps with what is known as the feature-positive effect (Allison and Messick 1988; Newman, Wolff, and Hearst 1980; Sainsbury 1971). This is the phenomenon in which we tend to overstate the importance of information that is (mentally) easily available to us and tilts our thinking towards the most recently acquired facts, not necessarily the most relevant ones. Without external help, we would not only take exclusively into account what we know, but what is on top of our heads.[35] The slip-box constantly reminds us of information we have long forgotten and wouldn’t remember otherwise – so much so, we wouldn’t even look for it. ([Location 2140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2140))
- Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s partner and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, stresses the importance of having a broad theoretical toolbox – not to be a good academic, but to have a good, pragmatic grip on reality. He regularly explains to students which mental models have proven most useful to help him understand markets and human behaviour. He advocates looking out for the most powerful concepts in every discipline and to try to understand them so thoroughly that they become part of our thinking. The moment one starts to combine these mental models and attach one’s experiences to them, one cannot help but gain what he calls “worldly wisdom.” The importance is to have not just a few, but a broad range of mental models in your head. Otherwise, you risk becoming too attached to one or two and see only what fits them. You would become the man with a hammer who sees nails everywhere (cf. Maslow, 1966, 15).

- A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes. This stands in harsh contrast to the common but not-so-wise belief that we need to learn from experience. It is much better to learn from the experiences of others – especially when this experience is reflected on and turned into versatile “mental models” that can be used in different situations.

- To be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from their original context by means of abstraction and re-specification. We did this when we took literature notes and translated them into the different contexts within the slip-box. Abstraction does not have a good reputation at the moment. It is the tangible, the concrete that is cheered for. Abstraction should indeed not be the final goal of thinking, but it is a necessary in-between step to make heterogeneous ideas compatible. If Darwin had never abstracted from his concrete observations of sparrows, he would never have found an abstract, a general principle of evolution across different species, and he would never have been able to see how evolution works in other species as well. Abstraction is also not for theoretical-academic processes of insight only. We need to abstract from concrete situations every day. Only by abstraction and re-specification can we apply ideas in the singular and always different situations in reality (Loewenstein, 2010).

- Studies on creativity with engineers show that the ability to find not only creative, but functional and working solutions for technical problems is equal to the ability to make abstractions. The better an engineer is at abstracting from a specific problem, the better and more pragmatic his solutions will be – even for the very problem he abstracted from (Gassmann and Zeschky, 2008, 103). Abstraction is also the key to analyse and compare concepts, to make analogies and to combine ideas; this is especially true when it comes to interdisciplinary work (Goldstone and Wilensky 2008).

- Our brains just love routines. Before new information prompts our brains to think differently about something, they make the new information fit into the known or let it disappear completely from our perception. Usually, we don’t even notice when our brains modify our surroundings to make it fit its expectations. We need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the power of thinking routines. In their book with the showy title “The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking”, the mathematicians Edward B. Burger and Michael Starbird collected different strategies to do that (2012). Some are already technically implemented in the slip-box, others are good to keep in mind. ([Location 2284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2284))

- Instead of widening the perspective to find as many possible lines of thought to which an idea might contribute, it is now about narrowing the perspective, making a decision on one topic only and cutting out everything that does not directly contribute to the development of the text and support the main argument.

- The process is self-reinforcing. A visibly developed cluster attracts more ideas and provides more possible connections, which in return influence our choices on what to read and think further. They become signposts for our daily work and orient us to what is worth thinking about. Topics grow bottom up and gain traction along the way. As soon as the slip-box has grown a bit, we can replace our thoughts on what is interesting and what we think is relevant with a pragmatic look into the slip-box, where we can plainly see what truly proved to be interesting and where we found material to work with.

- Good questions are in the sweet spot of being relevant and interesting, not too easy to answer but possible to tackle with material that is available or at least within our reach. When it comes to finding good questions, it is therefore not enough to think about it. We have to do something with an idea before we know enough about it to make a good judgement. We have to work, write, connect, differentiate, complement and elaborate on questions – but this is what we do when we take smart notes.

- Being intimately familiar with something enables us to be playful with it, to modify it, to spot new and different ideas without running the risk of merely repeating old ideas believing they are new. This is why it feels in the beginning that familiarity makes it harder to come up with new ideas. We just didn’t know that most of the ideas we had are actually not that innovative. But while the belief in our own ingenuity decreases with expertise, we become more able to actually make a genuine new contribution.

- If open-mindedness is all that is needed, the best artists and scientists were hobbyists. Jeremy Dean, who has written extensively on routines and rituals and suggests seeing old ways of thinking as thinking routines, puts it well when he writes that we cannot break with a certain way of thinking if we are not even aware that it is a certain way of thinking (Dean, 2013).

- These findings are an important argument for academic freedom. Nothing motivates us more than seeing a project we can identify with moving forward, and nothing is more demotivating than being stuck with a project that doesn’t seem to be worth doing. The risk of losing interest in what we do is high when we decide upfront on a long-term project without much clue about what to expect. We can mitigate this risk considerably by applying a flexible organisation scheme that allows us to change course whenever necessary.

- The ability to change the direction of our work opportunistically is a form of control that is completely different from the attempt to control the circumstances by clinging to a plan. ([Location 2517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2517))
- It is not just about feeling in control, it is about setting up the work in a way that we really are in control. And the more control we have to steer our work towards what we consider interesting and relevant, the less willpower we have to put into getting things done.

- An important question that deserved empirical attention concerns the potential for autonomous choice to vitalise or enhance self-regulatory strength for subsequent tasks. ([Location 2530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2530))
- The problem in this stage is almost exactly the opposite of the “blank screen.” Instead of not knowing how to fill the pages, we have so much at hand that we have to curb our impulse to mention everything at the same time.

- The slip-box is in some way what the chemical industry calls “verbund.” This is a setup in which the inevitable by-product of one production line becomes the resource for another, which again produces by-products that can be used in other processes and so on, until a network of production lines becomes so efficiently intertwined that there is no chance of an isolated factory competing with it anymore.[40] ([Location 2557](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2557))
- If we read something that is interesting, but not directly relevant to our current project, we can still use it for another project we are working on or might work on. Everything that enriches our slip-box has the potential to end up in a text we might write. By taking smart notes, we collect en passant the material for our future writings in one place. The projects we work on can be in completely different stages of completion. Some of them might not even have come to our attention. This is advantageous not only because we make progress on the next papers or books while we are still working on the current one, but also because it allows us to switch to other projects whenever we get stuck or bored.

- While it doesn’t help to imagine oneself the great author of a successful and timely finished paper, it does make a difference if we have a realistic idea about what needs to be done to get there in our minds. We know from sports that it doesn’t help when athletes imagine themselves as winners of a race, but it makes a big difference if they imagine all the training that is necessary to be able to win. Having a more realistic idea in mind not only helps them to perform better, it also boosts their motivation (Singer et al. 2001).

- Once we do some research, we may discover that our initial idea was not as good as we thought; once we read something, it is likely that we will discover something else to read, because that is how we discover literature; once we start writing down our arguments, it is likely that we will realise that we need to take something else into account, change our initial ideas or go back to an article we might not have understood well enough. None of this is unusual, but all of this will mess up any grand plans. ([Location 2614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2614))

- When we perform an action repeatedly, its familiarity seems to bleed back into our judgments about that behavior. We end up feeling we have more control over precisely the behaviours that, in reality, we have the least control over.

- The goal here is to get into the habit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write down the most important and interesting aspects. If we manage to establish a routine in this first step, it becomes much easier to develop the urge to turn these findings into permanent notes and connect them with other notes in the slip-box.

- The slip-box does not put the learner in the centre. Quite the contrary: It allows the learner to let his or her own thinking become decentralised within a network of other ideas. Learning, thinking and writing should not be about accumulating knowledge, but about becoming a different person with a different way of thinking. This is done by questioning one’s own thinking routines in the light of new experiences and facts. ([Location 2706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2706))
