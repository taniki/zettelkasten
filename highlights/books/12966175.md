## Highlights
- The men and women in the crowd argued with her, and with one another. They kept crossing the road, and some came inside the wall. Yet they did more or less clear the way. If the foreman had no experience in bossing a mob, they had no experience in being one. Members of a community, not elements of a collectivity, they were not moved by mass feeling; there were as many emotions there as there were people. And they did not expect commands to be arbitrary, so they had no practice in disobeying them. Their inexperience saved the passenger’s life.

- They hadn’t been posted, just as they were beginning independent research, to a damned tree-planting project. Their central function wasn’t being wasted. They were working: doing what they wanted to do. He was not working. He was being worked. ([Location 740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0151Q54OE&location=740))
- It is of the nature of idea to be communicated: written, spoken, done. The idea is like grass. It craves light, likes crowds, thrives on crossbreeding, grows better for being stepped on. ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0151Q54OE&location=1071))
- It was quite possible that a General Theory of temporality was an illusory goal. It was also possible that, though Sequency and Simultaneity might some day be unified in a general theory, he was not the man to do the job. He had been trying for ten years, and had not done it. Mathematicians and physicists, athletes of intellect, do their great work young. He had just had his fortieth birthday. It was more than possible—probable—that he was burnt out, finished.

- “How—how do you reconcile them?” the shy man asked earnestly. Shevek nearly laughed in despair. “I don’t know. I have been working a long time on it! After all, the rock does hit the tree. Neither pure sequency nor pure unity will explain it. We don’t want purity, but complexity, the relationship of cause and effect, means and end. Our model of the cosmos must be as inexhaustible as the cosmos. A complexity that includes not only duration but creation, not only being but becoming, not only geometry but ethics. It is not the answer we are after, but only how to ask the question….” ([Location 3314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0151Q54OE&location=3314))
- An Odonian undertook monogamy just as he might undertake a joint enterprise in production, a ballet or a soap-works. Partnership was a voluntarily constituted federation like any other. So long as it worked, it worked, and if it didn’t work it stopped being. It was not an institution but a function. It had no sanction but that of private conscience.

- Pae was a very clever physicist. Or, more exactly, he was very clever about physics. He had not done anything original, but his opportunism, his sense for where advantage lay, led him time after time to the most promising field.

- You cannot buy the Revolution. You cannot make the Revolution. You can only be the Revolution. It is in your spirit, or it is nowhere.” ([Location 4409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0151Q54OE&location=4409))
