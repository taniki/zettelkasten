## Highlights
- The biggest lesson I learned is something that’s since been corroborated by researchers, as we’ll see in this book: our judgment isn’t limited by knowledge nearly as much as it’s limited by attitude. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=123))
- The investigation of Dreyfus is an example of an aspect of human psychology called directionally motivated reasoning—or, more often, just motivated reasoning—in which our unconscious motives affect the conclusions we draw. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=215))
- Even if you’ve never heard the phrase motivated reasoning, I’m sure you’re already familiar with the phenomenon. It’s all around you under different names—denial, wishful thinking, confirmation bias, rationalization, tribalism, self-justification, overconfidence, delusion. Motivated reasoning is so fundamental to the way our minds work that it’s almost strange to have a special name for it; perhaps it should just be called reasoning. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=228))
- Picquart’s process of coming to realize that Dreyfus was innocent is a striking example of what cognitive scientists sometimes call accuracy motivated reasoning. In contrast to directionally motivated reasoning, which evaluates ideas through the lenses of “Can I believe it?” and “Must I believe it?,” accuracy motivated reasoning evaluates ideas through the lens of “Is it true?” ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=305))
- The scout isn’t indifferent. A scout might hope to learn that the path is safe, that the other side is weak, or that there’s a bridge conveniently located where his forces need to cross the river. But above all, he wants to learn what’s really there, not fool himself into drawing a bridge on his map where there isn’t one in real life. Being in scout mindset means wanting your “map”—your perception of yourself and the world—to be as accurate as possible. ([Location 316](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=316))
- Striving for an accurate map means being aware of the limits of your understanding, keeping track of the regions of your map that are especially sketchy or possibly wrong. And it means always being open to changing your mind in response to new information. In scout mindset, there’s no such thing as a “threat” to your beliefs. If you find out you were wrong about something, great—you’ve improved your map, and that can only help you. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=321))
- Being the kind of person who welcomes the truth, even if it’s painful, is what makes other people willing to be honest with you. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=348))
- We’re all a mixture of scout and soldier. But some people, in some contexts, are better scouts than most. Like Picquart, they’re more genuinely desirous of the truth, even if it’s not what they were hoping for, and less willing to accept bad arguments that happen to be convenient. They’re more motivated to go out, test their theories, and discover their mistakes. They’re more conscious of the possibility that their map of reality could be wrong, and more open to changing their mind. This book is about what those people are doing right, and what we can learn from them to help us move from soldier to scout ourselves. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=374))
- Psychologists make a distinction between self-enhancement, which means boosting your ego with positive beliefs, and self-protection, which means avoiding blows to your ego. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=460))
- COMFORT, SELF-ESTEEM, and morale are emotional benefits, meaning that the ultimate target of our deception is ourselves. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=485))
- Psychologists call it impression management, and evolutionary psychologists call it signaling: When considering a claim, we implicitly ask ourselves, “What kind of person would believe a claim like this, and is that how I want other people to see me?” ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=516))
- What makes it motivated reasoning is when you wouldn’t even want to find out if the consensus was wrong. ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=546))
- Fitting in isn’t only about conforming to the group consensus. It also means demonstrating your loyalty to the group by rejecting any evidence that threatens its figurative honor. ([Location 553](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=553))

- We use soldier mindset to help us maintain beliefs that boost our self-esteem, give us comfort, preserve our morale, persuade other people, cultivate an attractive image, and help us fit in to our social groups. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=591))

- We trade off between judgment and persuasion. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=614))
- We trade off between judgment and morale. ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=619))
- We make these trade-offs, and many more, all the time, usually without even realizing we’re doing so. After all, the whole point of self-deception is that it’s occurring beneath our conscious awareness. If you were to find yourself thinking, explicitly, “Should I admit to myself that I screwed up?” the issue would already be moot. So it’s left up to our unconscious minds to choose, on a case-by-case basis, which goals to prioritize. Sometimes we choose soldier mindset, furthering our emotional or social goals at the expense of accuracy. Sometimes we choose scout mindset, seeking out the truth even if it turns out not to be what we were hoping for. ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=622))
- The hypothesis that the human mind evolved the ability to make these trade-offs well is called the rational irrationality hypothesis, coined by economist Bryan Caplan. ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=638))
- A rationally irrational person would deny problems only when the comfort of denial is sufficiently high and their chance of fixing the problem is sufficiently low. ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=644))

- The source of this self-sabotage is present bias, a feature of our intuitive decision-making in which we care too much about short-term consequences and too little about long-term consequences. In other words, we’re impatient, and we get more impatient as the potential rewards grow closer.2 ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=657))
- The cost is that you miss out on learning from your mistake, which means you’re less able to prevent it from happening again. But that won’t affect you until some unknown point in the future. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=669))
- Analogously, the benefit of an act of scout mindset isn’t just about making your map of reality a bit more accurate. The benefit is in the habits and skills you’re reinforcing. ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=684))
- The trope is exaggerated for comic effect, but it’s based on a real phenomenon: when you tell a lie, it’s hard to predict exactly what you’ve committed your future self to. Just like the lies we tell others, the lies we tell ourselves have ripple effects. Suppose you tend to rationalize away your own mistakes, and consequently you see yourself as more perfect than you really are. This has a ripple effect on your views of other people: Now, when your friends and family screw up, you might not be very sympathetic. After all, you never make such mistakes. Why can’t they just be better? It’s not that hard. ([Location 697](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=697))
- Ripple effects are yet more reason to suspect that we underestimate the cost of deceiving ourselves—and are therefore choosing soldier mindset too often and scout mindset not often enough. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=711))
- Social costs like looking weird or making a fool out of ourselves feel a lot more significant than they actually are. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=724))
- We underestimate the cumulative harm of false beliefs, and the cumulative benefit of practicing scout habits. We overestimate how much other people judge us, and how much impact their judgments have on our lives. As a result of all these tendencies, we end up being far too willing to sacrifice our ability to see clearly in exchange for short-term emotional and social rewards. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=754))
- A KEY FACTOR preventing us from being in scout mindset more frequently is our conviction that we’re already in it. ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=800))
- The more objective you think you are, the more you trust your own intuitions and opinions as accurate representations of reality, and the less inclined you are to question them. ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=810))
- The point is simply that as people become better informed, they should start to converge on the truth, wherever it happens to be. Instead, we see the opposite pattern—as people get better informed, they diverge. ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=858))

- Intelligence and knowledge are just tools. You can use those tools to help you see the world clearly, if that’s what you’re motivated to do. Or you can use them to defend a particular viewpoint, if you’re motivated to do that instead. ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=879))
- The only real sign of a scout is whether you act like one. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=895))
- Forcing is what your brain is doing to get away with motivated reasoning while still making you feel like you’re being objective. ([Location 1028](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1028))
- You can’t detect motivated reasoning in yourself just by scrutinizing your reasoning and concluding that it makes sense. You have to compare your reasoning to the way you would have reasoned in a counter-factual world, a world in which your motivations were different—would you judge that politician’s actions differently if he was in the opposite party? Would you evaluate that advice differently if your friend had offered it instead of your spouse? Would you consider that study’s methodology sound if its conclusions supported your side? ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1048))
- THE DOUBLE STANDARD TEST ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1071))
- THE OUTSIDER TEST ([Location 1093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1093))
- THE CONFORMITY TEST ([Location 1122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1122))
- THE SELECTIVE SKEPTIC TEST ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1144))
- THE STATUS QUO BIAS TEST ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1164))
- A leading theory for why we’re biased in favor of the status quo is that we’re loss averse: the pain we feel from a loss outweighs the pleasure we feel from a similar-size gain. ([Location 1170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1170))
- What thought experiments do is simply reveal that your reasoning changes as your motivations change. That the principles you’re inclined to invoke or the objections that spring to your mind depend on your motives: the motive to defend your image or your in-group’s status; the motive to advocate for a self-serving policy; fear of change or rejection. ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1205))
- Catching your brain in the act of motivated reasoning—noticing when an experiment’s previously invisible flaws jump out at you, or noticing that your preferences change as you switch around supposedly irrelevant details of a scenario—breaks down the illusion that your initial judgment is the objective truth. It convinces you, viscerally, that your reasoning is contingent; that your initial judgments are a starting point for exploration, not an end point. ([Location 1208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1208))
- Not all overconfidence is due to motivated reasoning. Sometimes we simply don’t realize how complicated a topic is, so we overestimate how easy it is to get the right answer. But a large portion of overconfidence stems from a desire to feel certain. Certainty is simple. Certainty is comfortable. Certainty makes us feel smart and competent. ([Location 1271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1271))
- What you’re implicitly aiming for when you tag your beliefs with various confidence levels is perfect calibration. That means your “50% sure” claims are in fact correct 50 percent of the time, your “60% sure” claims are correct 60 percent of the time, your “70% sure” claims are correct 70 percent of the time, and so on. ([Location 1285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1285))
- The press secretary makes claims; the board makes bets. ([Location 1482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1482))

- The word bet might conjure up horse races and blackjack tables, but its meaning is far more general. A bet is any decision in which you stand to gain or lose something of value, based on the outcome. That could include money, health, time—or reputation, as in the case of your catering friend who wants your endorsement. So when you’re thinking about how sure you are, your answer will be more honest if you switch from thinking in terms of “What can I get away with claiming to myself?” to “How would I bet, if there was something at stake?” ([Location 1483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1483))
- THE EQUIVALENT BET TEST ([Location 1502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1502))
- There’s a core skill in this chapter, too: being able to tell the difference between the feeling of making a claim and the feeling of actually trying to guess what’s true. Making a claim feels like your press secretary is speaking. It feels pat; neat and tidy. Sometimes hurried, as if you’re trying to put something past yourself. The mental motion is declaring, proclaiming, insisting, or perhaps scoffing. Trying to guess what’s true feels like being the board of directors, deciding how to bet. There’s at least a second or two when you don’t know what answer you’re going to end up giving. It’s like you’re squinting at the evidence, trying to summarize what you see. The mental motions involved are estimating, predicting, weighing, and deliberating. ([Location 1555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1555))
- One of the most fundamental human needs is to feel like things are basically okay: that we’re not failures, that the world isn’t a horrible place, and that whatever life throws at us, we’ll be able to handle it. In a life-or-death situation, of course, this need is especially hard to satisfy. That’s why most people in an emergency resort to various forms of motivated reasoning, like denial, wishful thinking, and rationalizing. ([Location 1596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1596))
- The trait that saved Callahan wasn’t an invulnerability to fear or depression. Like anyone else in a dire situation, he struggled to keep despair at bay. The trait that saved him was his commitment to finding ways of keeping despair at bay without distorting his map of reality. ([Location 1606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1606))
- In the book Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me), psychologists Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson explore self-justification, a type of motivated reasoning in which you convince yourself after the fact that you made the right choice. ([Location 1620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1620))
- Scouts aren’t invulnerable to fear, anxiety, insecurity, despair, or any of the other emotions that give rise to motivated reasoning, and they rely on coping strategies just like anyone else. They just take more care to select coping strategies that don’t mess with the accuracy of their judgment. ([Location 1645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1645))
- Remember, the goal isn’t to convince yourself that your misfortune is actually a good thing. You’re not looking for a “sweet lemons” rationalization here. You’re recognizing a silver lining to the cloud, not trying to convince yourself the whole cloud is silver. But in many cases, that’s all you need—noticing the silver lining is enough to make you willing to accept the reality of the cloud. ([Location 1685](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1685))
- The suggestions in this chapter such as making a plan, finding silver linings, and changing your goal are just a sample of some of the ways scouts have found to manage their emotions. Different strategies work for different people. One friend of mine copes with painful criticism by conjuring up a feeling of gratitude toward his critic. This works for him but does not work for me at all. Instead, I cope by focusing on how much better I’m going to be in the future if I can get myself to think honestly about the criticism. ([Location 1768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1768))
- Your ability to see clearly is precious, and you should be reluctant to sacrifice it in exchange for emotional comfort. ([Location 1773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1773))
- In reality, you almost never get to repeat the exact same bet many times. But you’ll have the opportunity to make many different bets over the course of your life. You’ll face bets at your company and in your career more broadly; bets on investment opportunities; chances to bet on trusting another person, or making a difficult ask, or pushing your comfort zone. And the more positive expected value bets you make, the more confident you can be that you’ll end up ahead overall, even if each individual bet is far from a sure thing. ([Location 1948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1948))
- The goal isn’t to attribute everything to luck. It’s to do your best to mentally separate out the role that luck plays in your results from the role that your decision-making plays, and to judge yourself based on the latter. ([Location 1974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=1974))
- Instead of being motivated by the promise of guaranteed success, a scout is motivated by the knowledge that they’re making a smart bet, which they can feel good about having made whether or not it succeeds. Even if a particular bet has a low probability of success, they know that their overall probability of success in the long run is much higher, as long as they keep making good bets. They’re motivated by the knowledge that downturns are inevitable, but will wash out in the long run; that although failure is possible, it’s also tolerable. ([Location 2017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2017))
- The scout approach to morale doesn’t ask you to sacrifice your ability to make clear-eyed decisions. And it’s a robust kind of morale, one that doesn’t require protection from reality, because it’s rooted in truth. ([Location 2022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2022))
- THE COMMON WISDOM is that the more confidence you can muster in your beliefs, the more influential you will be. Confidence is magnetic. It invites people to listen to you, follow you, and trust that you know what you’re doing. ([Location 2043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2043))
- Confidence is one of those words that we use to mean different things without even realizing it. One is epistemic confidence, or certainty— how sure you are about what’s true. This is the kind of confidence we explored in chapter 6. If you say, “I’m 99 percent sure he is lying,” or “I guarantee this will work,” or “There’s no way the Republicans can win,” you’re displaying a lot of epistemic confidence. Separately, there’s social confidence, or self-assurance: Are you at ease in social situations? Do you act like you deserve to be there, like you’re secure in yourself and your role in the group? Do you speak as if you’re worth listening to? ([Location 2055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2055))
- People sometimes bemoan the fact that “superficial” things like posture and voice make such a difference in how we judge each other. But on the bright side, that means that projecting competence doesn’t require self-deception. You can boost your social confidence through practice speaking up in groups, hiring a speech coach, dressing better, improving your posture—all without compromising your ability to see things clearly. ([Location 2109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2109))
- These are clearly two very different kinds of uncertainty. One can hardly blame the patients in the first group for being put off. If a doctor says, “I’m not sure what’s causing this,” it’s reasonable to wonder whether a better, more experienced doctor would be able to diagnose you. In the second group, however, the doctors sound like experts even while they’re giving an uncertain diagnosis. They’re offering useful context, such as the fact that a woman’s age during her first pregnancy is a stronger risk factor than whether or not she breastfeeds, and they’re giving informative estimates, such as “probably between one in five and one in ten,” rather than simply saying they don’t know. ([Location 2136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2136))
- Even if reality is messy and it’s impossible to know the right answer with confidence, you can at least be confident in your analysis. ([Location 2166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2166))
- One reason people don’t like hearing uncertain answers is that it leaves them at a loss for how to act. You can reassure them by following up your uncertainty with a plan or recommendation. ([Location 2178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2178))
- You can set ambitious goals. You can paint a vivid picture of the world you want to create. You can speak from the heart about why you personally care about this issue. When my friend is talking about his company, he likes to share real stories of people who struggled with mental health and have been helped by his app. All of those things can be inspiring, and none of them require you to make unrealistic claims. ([Location 2195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2195))
- Second, expressing uncertainty isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It depends on whether the uncertainty is “in you” or “in the world.” If you can demonstrate a strong command of the topic and speak with ease about your analysis and your plan, you’ll seem like more of an expert, not less. ([Location 2215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2215))
- The superforecasters changed their minds all the time. Not dramatic, 180-degree reversals every day, but subtle revisions as they learned new information. The highest-scoring superforecaster, a software engineer named Tim Minto, usually changed his mind at least a dozen times on a single forecast, and sometimes as much as forty or fifty times. ([Location 2258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2258))
- Changing your mind frequently, especially about important beliefs, might sound mentally and emotionally taxing. But, in a way, it’s less stressful than the alternative. If you see the world in binary black-andwhite terms, then what happens when you encounter evidence against one of your beliefs? The stakes are high: you have to find a way to dismiss the evidence, because if you can’t, your entire belief is in jeopardy. ([Location 2286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2286))
- Since beginning his study of forecasting in the 1980s, Tetlock has heard hundreds of justifications for failed forecasts, which he has catalogued into seven belief system defenses. ([Location 2298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2298))
- The superforecasters had a very different relationship with their mistakes. When their predictions missed the mark by a lot—if they predicted something was very likely and it didn’t happen or if they predicted something was very unlikely and it did happen— they would go back and reevaluate their process, asking, “What does this teach me about how to make better forecasts?” ([Location 2304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2304))
- This is another reason superforecasters are much happier to think about what they got wrong—they know that analyzing their errors is an opportunity to hone their technique. Lessons like “Don’t assume world leaders would react the same way as you” are like power-ups, upgrades to your mental arsenal that make you smarter going forward. ([Location 2315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2315))
- Domain-general lessons are about how the world works, or how your own brain works, and about the kinds of biases that tend to influence your judgment. ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2337))
- First, they revise their opinions incrementally over time, which makes it easier to be open to evidence against their beliefs. Second, they view errors as opportunities to hone their skill at getting things right, which makes the experience of realizing “I was wrong” feel valuable, rather than just painful. ([Location 2353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2353))
- The word admit makes it sound like you screwed up but that you deserve to be forgiven because you’re only human. It doesn’t question the premise that being wrong means you screwed up. ([Location 2369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2369))
- You’ve learned new information and come to a new conclusion, but that doesn’t mean you were wrong to believe differently in the past. The only reason to be contrite is if you were negligent in some way. Did you get something wrong because you followed a process you should have known was bad? Were you willfully blind or stubborn or careless? ([Location 2371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2371))
- But most of the time, being wrong doesn’t mean you did something wrong. It’s not something you need to apologize for, and the appropriate attitude to have about it is neither defensive nor humbly self-flagellating, but matter-of-fact. ([Location 2377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2377))
- Even the language scouts use to describe being wrong reflects this attitude. Instead of “admitting a mistake,” scouts will sometimes talk about “updating.” That’s a reference to Bayesian updating, a technical term from probability theory for the correct way to revise a probability after learning new information. ([Location 2379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2379))
- An update is routine. Low-key. It’s the opposite of an overwrought confession of sin. An update makes something better or more current without implying that its previous form was a failure. ([Location 2396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2396))
- Knowing that you’re fallible doesn’t magically prevent you from being wrong. But it does allow you to set expectations early and often, which can make it easier to accept when you are wrong. ([Location 2423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2423))
- Discovering you were wrong is an update, not a failure, and your worldview is a living document meant to be revised. ([Location 2429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2429))
- OUR ABILITY TO change our minds depends on how we react when the world confounds your expectations. ([Location 2451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2451))
- We couldn’t function in the world if we were constantly questioning our perception of reality. But especially when motivated reasoning is in play, we take it too far, shoehorning conflicting evidence into a narrative well past the point where we should have taken a step back and said, “Wait, am I misinterpreting what’s going on here?” ([Location 2456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2456))
- This chapter is about how to resist the urge to dismiss details that don’t fit your theories, and instead, allow yourself to be confused and intrigued by them, to see them as puzzles to be solved, like the mysterious floating rock in the raccoon photograph. ([Location 2464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2464))
- Within a few years, he had figured out the beginnings of a compelling answer. Natural selection wasn’t the only force shaping evolution. Sexual selection was just as important. Some features, like a big, gaudy tail, were especially attractive to members of the opposite sex. Those features could therefore become common in a species over time, because even though they might hurt the animal’s odds of surviving, they helped the animal’s odds of reproducing. The latter could outweigh the former. ([Location 2485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2485))
- If you want to become better at predicting people’s behavior, then shrugging off the times when they violate your expectations is exactly the wrong response. ([Location 2520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2520))
- That’s the thing about surprising and confusing observations. You don’t know in advance what they’ll teach you. All too often, we assume the only two possibilities are “I’m right” or “The other guy is right”— and since the latter seems absurd, we default to the former. But in many cases, there’s an unknown unknown, a hidden “option C,” that enriches our picture of the world in a way we wouldn’t have been able to anticipate. ([Location 2596](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2596))
- ALL OF THESE examples have been about how a single puzzling observation can change your worldview. But more often than not, it’s the accumulation of many puzzling observations over time that changes your mind—a paradigm shift. ([Location 2600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2600))
- A paradigm shift starts with a core belief, or paradigm, that everyone assumes is true. Gradually, some people observe anomalies, things that don’t seem to fit with that paradigm. At first, scientists shrug off those anomalies as exceptions or mistakes, or they modify their paradigm a little bit at a time to accommodate the new observations. But the more anomalies accumulate, the more confused the scientists become, until someone eventually develops a new paradigm that makes everything make sense again. ([Location 2604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2604))
- The rule for paradigm shifts in life is the same as it is in science. Acknowledge anomalies, even if you don’t yet know how to explain them, and even if the old paradigm still seems correct overall. Maybe they’ll add up to nothing in particular. Maybe they just mean that reality is messy. But maybe they’re laying the groundwork for a big change of view. ([Location 2608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2608))
- It’s a tricky skill. It forces you to act without clarity, to operate under one paradigm while being aware of its flaws and inconsistencies, knowing that it might be wrong and that you might end up abandoning it. You have to resist the temptation to resolve inconsistency prematurely by forcing all of your observations into one paradigm, and instead be willing to remain confused—for days, weeks, or even years. ([Location 2672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2672))
- LEANING IN TO confusion is about inverting the way you’re used to seeing the world. Instead of dismissing observations that contradict your theories, get curious about them. Instead of writing people off as irrational when they don’t behave the way you think they should, ask yourself why their behavior might be rational. Instead of trying to fit confusing observations into your preexisting theories, treat them as clues to a new theory. ([Location 2692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2692))
- One month later, researchers measured the political attitudes of their participants. Had their views been moderated by the foray outside their echo chambers? Quite the contrary. Conservatives who spent a month reading liberal tweets became dramatically more conservative. Liberals who spent a month reading conservative tweets became slightly more liberal (though the effect wasn’t statistically significant). ([Location 2741](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2741))
- To give yourself the best chance of learning from disagreement, you should be listening to people who make it easier to be open to their arguments, not harder. People you like or respect, even if you don’t agree with them. People with whom you have some common ground—intellectual premises, or a core value that you share—even though you disagree with them on other issues. People whom you consider reasonable, who acknowledge nuance and areas of uncertainty, and who argue in good faith. ([Location 2751](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2751))
- One of the biggest reasons we fail to learn from disagreements is that we expect it to be easier than it actually is. ([Location 2855](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2855))
- There’s background context you’re missing, words being used in different ways than you’re used to, and more. ([Location 2873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2873))
- When we do encounter a good argument that’s new to us, we often mistake it for a bad argument we’re already familiar with. ([Location 2875](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2875))
- along the way. Scouts have the opposite assumption. We all start out with wildly incorrect maps, and over time, as we get more information, we make them somewhat more accurate. Revising your map is a sign you’re doing things right. ([Location 2909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2909))
- Listening to views you disagree with, and taking them seriously enough to have a shot at changing your mind, requires mental effort, emotional effort, and, above all, patience. ([Location 2917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2917))
- It’s an age-old rule of etiquette that you’re not supposed to make conversation about politics or religion. That’s because we all know that people’s political and religious views are often part of their identities. When someone criticizes a belief that’s part of your identity, it’s antagonizing. It’s like someone insulting your family or stomping on your country’s flag. Even just discovering that someone disagrees with you about an identity-laden belief is like finding out they’re on a rival team: “Oh, so you’re one of them.” ([Location 2959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2959))
- Beliefs crystallize into identities through the feeling of being under siege from a hostile world, much the way prolonged pressure bonds carbon atoms together to form a diamond. ([Location 2976](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=2976))

- Beliefs also become part of your identity when they come to represent some virtue you take pride in. ([Location 3001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3001))
- Both self-identified optimists and pessimists take pride in their way of seeing the world. Optimists often talk as if holding positive beliefs is a sign of virtue: “Despite how easy it would be to choose cynicism, I choose to believe in humanity’s inherent goodness,” one optimist declared.13 Meanwhile, pessimists see themselves as savvy and sophisticated, unlike those insipid optimists: “In investing, a bull sounds like a reckless cheerleader, while a bear sounds like a sharp mind who has dug past the headlines,” one investor observed. ([Location 3013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3013))
- That seemingly redundant phrase—shouldn’t it go without saying that you believe your own statements?—signals that you’re not simply describing the world, you’re defining yourself. ([Location 3064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3064))
- Economics columnist Megan McArdle came up with the perfect analogy for what the righteous tone of voice is meant to convey. “The messages that make you feel great about yourself (and of course, your like-minded friends) are the ones that suggest you’re a moral giant striding boldly across the landscape, wielding your inescapable ethical logic,” she wrote.25 ([Location 3092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3092))
- When a label is more than just a practical description of your beliefs—when it feels like a status symbol or a source of pride—then the question of who else gets to wear that label actually matters. It becomes important to police the identity’s boundaries. ([Location 3101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3101))
- Deriving pleasure from news that humiliates some ideological group you disagree with is a sign of an “oppositional identity”—an identity defined by what it opposes. It’s easy to overlook these because they often don’t involve labels of their own, but they can distort your judgment all the same. ([Location 3113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3113))
- If you use epithets like these in talking about a particular issue, that’s a sign you’re viewing it as a fight between people, not ideas. That doesn’t necessarily mean your position on the issue is wrong or that the other side is right, but it does mean that your identity is probably coloring your judgment. ([Location 3122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3122))
- The problem is compounded if you’ve had to defend your view against unfair or aggressive criticism. Now, changing your mind feels like letting the enemy win. ([Location 3130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3130))
- The problem with identity is that it wrecks your ability to think clearly. Identifying with a belief makes you feel like you have to be ready to defend it, which motivates you to focus your attention on collecting evidence in its favor. Identity makes you reflexively reject arguments that feel like attacks on you or the status of your group. ([Location 3137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3137))
- Holding an identity lightly means thinking of it in a matter-of-fact way, rather than as a central source of pride and meaning in your life. It’s a description, not a flag to be waved proudly. ([Location 3171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3171))
- Holding an identity lightly means treating that identity as contingent, saying to yourself, “I’m a liberal, for as long as it continues to seem to me that liberalism is just.” Or “I’m a feminist, but I would abandon the movement if for some reason I came to believe it was causing net harm.” It means maintaining a sense of your own beliefs and values, independent of the tribe’s beliefs and values, and acknowledging—at least in the privacy of your own head—the places where those two things diverge. ([Location 3185](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3185))
- The ideological Turing test, suggested by economist Bryan Caplan, is based on similar logic.11 It’s a way to determine if you really understand an ideology: Can you explain it as a believer would, convincingly enough that other people couldn’t tell the difference between you and a genuine believer? ([Location 3227](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3227))
- The ideological Turing test is typically seen as a test of your knowledge: How thoroughly do you understand the other side’s beliefs? But it also serves as an emotional test: Do you hold your identity lightly enough to be able to avoid caricaturing your ideological opponents? ([Location 3258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3258))
- It feels like you’re giving aid and comfort to the enemy. But if you want to have a shot at actually changing people’s point of view rather than merely being disgusted at how wrong they are, understanding those views is a must. ([Location 3261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3261))
- Usually, however, activists face trade-offs between identity and impact—and the more lightly you hold your identity, the more you can focus exclusively on actions with the highest impact. ([Location 3323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3323))
- Many identity-affirming actions, in turn, have little real-world impact. ([Location 3328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3328))
- An effective activist must hold their identity lightly enough to be able to make clear-eyed assessments of the best ways to achieve their goals while still being able to work passionately toward those goals. ([Location 3335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3335))
- To be an effective activist you need to be able to perceive when it will be most impactful to cooperate, and when it will be most impactful to disrupt, on a case-by-case basis. ([Location 3382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3382))
- Holding your identity lightly is what allows you to make those judgment calls as well as possible. It’s not a favor you do for other people, for the sake of being nice or civil. Holding your identity lightly is a favor to yourself—a way to keep your mind flexible, unconstrained by identity, and free to follow the evidence wherever it leads. ([Location 3384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3384))
- That’s a common theme among people who are good at facing hard truths, changing their mind, taking criticism, and listening to opposing views. Scout mindset isn’t a chore they carry out grudgingly; it’s a deep personal value of theirs, something they take pride in. ([Location 3418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3418))
- If you pride yourself on being a scout, it becomes easier to resist the temptation to mock someone who disagrees with you, because you can remind yourself, “I’m not the kind of person who takes cheap shots,” and get a hit of pride. It becomes easier to acknowledge when you make a mistake, because you can tell yourself, “I don’t make excuses for myself,” and feel a rush of satisfaction. And sometimes, those hits of pride or satisfaction are enough to make the scout path more tempting than the soldier path. ([Location 3450](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3450))
- Think about how you feel the day after an especially strenuous workout. Your muscles are sore. But doesn’t the soreness, although uncomfortable, also feel kind of satisfying? It’s a reminder that you did something hard that’s going to pay off for you in the long run. If you have a scout identity, that’s how it feels when you realize you have to change your mind. It’s not that it’s easy; it still stings a little to realize that you made a mistake or that the person you’ve been arguing with actually has a point. But that slight sting is a reminder that you’re living up to your standards, that you’re becoming stronger. And so the sensation becomes pleasurable, in the same way sore muscles can be pleasurable for someone making progress toward getting in shape. ([Location 3463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3463))
- I’ve focused almost exclusively on what you as an individual can do to change your thinking, holding the world around you constant, because I wanted this book to be useful to you right away. But in the medium-to-long term, one of the biggest things you can do to change your thinking is to change the people you surround yourself with. We humans are social creatures, and our identities are shaped by our social circles, almost without our noticing. ([Location 3482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3482))
- You can make the effort to think honestly no matter what community you’re embedded in. But your friends, coworkers, and audience can either provide a headwind or a tailwind for your efforts. ([Location 3489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3489))
- Whether you’re starting a company, growing an audience for your writing or networking with potential clients, you build a niche for yourself based on how you talk and act. If you strive to be a scout, it’s true that you won’t please everyone. However—as your parents may have told you growing up—that’s impossible anyway. So you might as well aim to please the kind of people you’d most like to have around you, people who you respect and who motivate you to be a better version of yourself. ([Location 3531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3531))

## New highlights added February 14, 2022 at 6:37 PM
- The people you read, follow, and talk to online help shape your identity just like the people in your “real-life” communities do. That can reinfoce soldier mindset if you spend your time with people who make you feel angry, defensive, and contemptuous. Or it can reinforce scout mindset if you spend your time in places like ChangeAView or r/FeMRADebates. You can even create a loosely knit “community” for yourself by making connections with people you see setting a good example of scout mindset online—bloggers, authors, or just random people on social media. ([Location 3561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3561))
- Personally, I find all those facets of scout mindset inspiring—the willingness to prioritize impact over identity; the confidence to be unconfident; the courage to face reality. But if I were to name one single facet I find most inspiring, it’s the idea of being intellectually honorable: wanting the truth to win out, and putting that principle above your own ego. ([Location 3616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3616))
- Most people think you have to choose between being happy and being realistic. And so they shrug, throw up their hands, and say, “Ah well, so much the worse for realism,” or sometimes, “Ah well, so much the worse for happiness.” A central theme of this book is that we don’t have to choose. With a bit of extra effort and cleverness, we can have both. We can find ways to cope with fear and insecurity. We can take bold risks and persevere in the face of setbacks. We can influence, persuade, and inspire. We can fight effectively for social change. And we can do all of this by understanding and working with what’s real, not shutting our eyes to it. ([Location 3640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3640))
- At the end of the day, we’re a bunch of apes whose brains were optimized for defending ourselves and our tribes, not for doing unbiased evaluations of scientific evidence. So why get angry at humanity for not being uniformly great at something we didn’t evolve to be great at? Wouldn’t it make more sense to appreciate the ways in which we do transcend our genetic legacy? ([Location 3672](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B089CJ6SVS&location=3672))
