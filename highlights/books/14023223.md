## Highlights
- ‘What does it mean to be a proletarian, really?’ Costa continued, without waiting for a reply. ‘Let me tell you. From bitter experience. It means you are a cog in a process of production that relies on what you do and think while excluding you from being anything but its product. It means the end of sovereignty, the conversion of all experiential value into exchange value, the final defeat of autonomy.’ ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=208))
- Science fiction is the archaeology of the future, a leftist philosopher once said. It is now on the verge of offering the best documentary of our present. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=226))
