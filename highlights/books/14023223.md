## Highlights
- ‘What does it mean to be a proletarian, really?’ Costa continued, without waiting for a reply. ‘Let me tell you. From bitter experience. It means you are a cog in a process of production that relies on what you do and think while excluding you from being anything but its product. It means the end of sovereignty, the conversion of all experiential value into exchange value, the final defeat of autonomy.’ ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=208))
- Science fiction is the archaeology of the future, a leftist philosopher once said. It is now on the verge of offering the best documentary of our present. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=226))

- ‘Capitalism and science fiction share one thing,’ he replied coolly. ‘They trade in future assets using fictitious currency. Even if these tools are still in the realm of science fiction, they are our best defence. Believe me, given half a chance the powerful will wage an all-out war against the rest of us using these high-tech weapons. We must deploy them first if we want to stand any chance of defending ourselves.’ ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=392))
- ‘My bosses understand,’ he explained, ‘that the best way to profit is first to establish a monopoly and then strategically to starve the market of the product they have monopolized.’ ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=411))
- With the arrival of Eva in our circle many years later, I realize now that three people had come together who had each in their different ways been lured in and then defeated by modernity: Iris by a long string of dispiriting leftist calamities, from the tragedy that befell her continental heroes Rosa Luxemburg and Aleksandra Kollontai to the triumph of Thatcher’s Britain; Eva by the weapons of mass financial destruction and ‘riskless risk’ that she herself had once peddled; Costa by his badly misplaced faith in the digital revolution’s emancipatory powers.

- In The Republic, Plato has Socrates ask: if you discovered such a ring, would it be rational not to use it to do as you please? Costa remembered Socrates’ answer well: anyone who uses the power of the ring to get what he wants enslaves himself to his own appetites. Happiness, and not just morality, hinges on one’s capacity not to use the ring’s exorbitant power. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=462))
- The ultimate goal of the Silicon Valley’s gaming corporations, he realized – and indeed the Holy Grail of big tech as a whole – was a device that replaces the hit-or-miss offerings of real life with a sufficiently realistic virtual reality machine tailoring its offering to each individual’s desires. ([Location 472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=472))
- The problem with humans, Costa surmised, is the same in real life as in digital games: we crave the company of other minds, whose validation is meaningful because they are beyond our control even while control of them is precisely what we seek. When they do things we do not want them to do, we get upset. But the moment we control them fully, their approval gives us no pleasure. It is ever so hard to learn to appreciate that the pleasure to be had from such control is illusory, especially since people are prepared to sacrifice almost everything in its pursuit. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=478))
- A machine that lets all of us experience – and share – our desires all at once. Freedom at last, not only from scarcity but also from what other people do to us, expect of us, or want from us. Suddenly, others would do, think and act in total sync with our dreams, hopes and aspirations. Constraints would become obsolete – a distant reminder of a primitive existence. Our dilemmas gone, all trade-offs eradicated, boundless satisfaction at our fingertips. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=485))
- For ever is a long time to be spent in any state of bliss, let alone in an illusion created by a machine. Even fools, radical hedonists and the clinically depressed would recoil from surrendering their minds to a machine for ever. Faced with the ultimate, really-existing Gyges’ ring, he had no doubt we would shock ourselves by saying no. And the moment we turned down the offer of a perfect multiverse, he postulated, we would be thrown into an existential spin, resulting in a state of sheer lucidity. Suddenly, we would grasp the truth that Socrates wanted us to understand: the greatest slavery is that of our own appetites. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=497))
- Merely by existing, the Freedom Machine would give us a priceless shot at the most liberating of epiphanies: that there is more to life than indulging desires and eliminating pain. ([Location 501](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=501))
- But what if Costa could adapt and develop his various inventions in such a way as to build a functional Freedom Machine, demonstrate that it worked as advertised and then give people the entirely real option of giving themselves to it for ever? What if people did indeed turn it down? Not only would Costa have gone one better than Socrates, he would have discovered a way to undermine the very basis of capitalism: people’s readiness to think of themselves as consumers. ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=504))
- Later, when extraordinary circumstances compelled him to explain it to Iris and Eva, Costa introduced HALPEVAM as the opposite of the misanthropic machines in The Matrix. ([Location 521](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=521))
- In the early days of HALPEVAM’s development, Costa was slowed down by a theoretical problem. What form would time take inside HALPEVAM’s multiverse? Specifically, how would time’s passage be experienced if one had infinite experiences all at once? Surely a life of boundless, overlapping experiences need last no more than a nanosecond? Time would be infinitely wide but infinitesimally brief. Had he discovered the secret of embedding an eternal heaven within a vanishingly short lifetime? ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=525))
- The challenge then became how to capture a complete and accurate picture of the user’s desires, passions, beliefs, whims and predilections. ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=537))
- When hierarchies are used to match people with particular roles and teams, the result is clumsy, inefficient, oppressive. Status anxiety and the need to satisfy one’s superiors make full transparency impossible. People are kept in the dark about the relative attractiveness or drawbacks of working with particular managers or colleagues, how happy or dysfunctional teams are, how rewarding or boring different projects. Hierarchies simply perpetuate and expand themselves, resulting in a terrible mismatch between a person’s standing and what they actually contribute. Even the hierarchy’s great advantage, of ensuring that all posts are staffed at all times, is a hidden loss. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=658))
- With people voting freely with their feet, an ongoing collective assessment takes place of each project’s relative value. If unpredictability is the price of staff autonomy, it is a small one to pay, Kosti reported. ([Location 666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=666))
- New staff are recruited on the understanding that, once in the company, no one can force them to be secretaries or accountants. ([Location 676](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=676))
- Before voting, staff are given at least a month to read up on each proposal, to debate them and to form their preferences. They are then invited to rank the proposals in order of preference on an electronic ballot form. ([Location 689](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=689))
- Every year, just before the New Year’s holidays, Kosti is given one hundred merit points to distribute among his colleagues. He can give all his one hundred merit points to a single colleague whom he thinks has done a uniquely exceptional job or he can spread them out more thinly among colleagues whom he thinks have made above-average contributions to the company. Meanwhile, all his colleagues do the same, resulting in each member of the company receiving a percentage of the total merit points, and it is this which determines the percentage of the bonus fund they receive. If, for example, Kosti collects 3 per cent of the total merit points, his personal bonus will be 3 per cent of the firm’s total bonus fund – whose size has already been determined via the preferential voting algorithm. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=700))
- Despite not having all the arguments sorted out in his head, Kosti’s description of corporate life in the Other Now changed everything for Costa. He was now able to imagine a modern, high-tech corporation where everyone shared the firm’s net revenues, albeit in proportion to the average opinion of their contribution, with no distinction between those who collected the profits and those who were paid a wage. ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=736))
- Like left-wing radicals, anarcho-syndicalists opposed private rights over property and the noxious division of earnings between wages for minions and profits for the masters. But anarcho-syndicalists went a step further and opposed the state itself, which they saw as the main defender of those property rights and corporate hierarchies. ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=743))
- If Costa had learned anything from his experience of corporate life, it was that power perverts and hierarchies are effective only at reproducing themselves, begetting even more corrupting power. In fact, the formal ownership of a company is of less importance, he decided, than the way in which power is structured and reproduced within it. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=754))
- Instead of the liquid, instantly tradable shares of Our Now, which grant their owners a claim over future profits produced by others, in the Other Now shares were similar to franchises: an automatic, non-transferable, personal right to participate on equal terms in the decision-making of the company one worked for.

- Dividend is largely funded by corporate revenues received by the state. In effect, the state taxes all corporations, usually at 5 per cent of gross revenues, to provide a social payment to all its citizens. ([Location 819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=819))
- Instead of a net that traps them, Dividend acts as a solid platform on which the poorer and the unluckier can stand, allowing them to reach for something better. ([Location 826](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=826))
- In direct contradiction of the myth promoted by capitalists and rentiers that wealth is produced by individuals, only to be collectivized by the state through taxation, the reality, Iris argued, is that wealth, like language, can only be produced collectively. Only then is it privatized by those with the power to do so. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=843))
- The incentive to lend to one’s new work community is twofold: a sense of reciprocal commitment and, more practically, the thought that otherwise the company will have to rely on loans from strangers, perhaps at a premium reflecting a higher risk assessment by outsiders. ([Location 880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=880))
- In the Other Now, Kosti explained, corporations are by nature much less commanding. The lack of stock exchanges and companies’ flat management structures keep their size relatively small – typically, no more than a few hundred staff. Nevertheless, Kosti was keen to point out that the public had demanded mechanisms that guaranteed corporate accountability to society. Hence the Other Now’s Social Accountability Act, which stipulates that every corporation is graded according to a Socialworthiness Index by regional panels of randomly selected local citizens known as Citizens’ Juries. ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=912))
- Turning people into numbers was awful, he felt. The surest way to destroy a quality is to turn it into a quantity. Was this not what capitalism had done to us? Reduce every value to a price, every exchange into a transaction, every thing of incalculable beauty into a measurable object of desire? And yet, despite his idealism, Costa also recognized that a democratic, technologically advanced, large-scale economy cannot be run like a commune. It needs numbers. Quantification is unavoidable. ([Location 939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=939))
- ‘If we are to carry around a number,’ Costa acknowledged, ‘it might as well convey our socialworthiness, not our creditworthiness. A number that is produced transparently, collectively and by randomly chosen fellow citizens – not by the bankers’ handmaidens.’ ([Location 953](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=953))
- That Astonishingly There Is AN Alternative. ([Location 969](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=969))

- And so too for the investment banks. It often struck Costa how few people really understood what they do. Despite their name, one thing they do not do is invest – at least, not in skills, equipment, solar panels, hospitals or anything else of tangible value. Investment bankers spend their considerable energies and talents conjuring up complicated trades involving debt and shares. ([Location 986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=986))
- Almost totally disconnected from actual profits, capitalism is powered by fictitious capital flowing from convoluted trades in profits that have not yet materialized – and may never do so! ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=1009))
- In the Other Now, the Ossify Wall Street movement, as it was known, sprang up in New York City just as Occupy Wall Street had in Our Now. However, over there it went global under the name Ossify Capitalism, or OC for short. At the time Costa had been excited by Occupy Wall Street and its various equivalents worldwide: the Indignados in Spain, who in their tens of thousands took over the plazas of the main Spanish cities; the Greek Aganaktismenoi, who made Syntagma Square their own for three joyous months in the spring of 2011; the Nuit debout gatherings a few years later in Paris. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=1034))
- The great difference between the two movements was that the OC rebels recognized the futility of occupying spaces – squares, streets or buildings. ([Location 1039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=1039))
- The Bladerunners did not fear technology, though. They celebrated the Luddites as history’s most misunderstood figures, whose vandalism of machines was a protest not against automation but against social arrangements that used technological innovation to deprive the majority of their dignity and life prospects. Indeed, the Bladerunners embraced digital platforms, even the rise of AI, but were adamant that such machines should be utilized in the cause of shared prosperity, not as instruments of neo-feudalism or of a class war by the few against the many. ([Location 1108](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=1108))
- Kosti had referred to this network as techno-syndicalism – adapting a term coined in the mid-1960s by John Kenneth Galbraith, an eminent twentieth-century American economist who referred to capitalism’s network of power, its agglomeration of mega-firms and mega-banks, as the Technostructure.

- It was something worse: a shared expectation that inhabited the common room just as patriarchy did the wider world. It was a common mistake to think that laws and written rules create networks of power. No, power networks emerge first. They do so organically and only then crystallize into codes, rules, regulations and, finally, law. Removing the rules that enshrine hierarchy in law will not end hierarchy any more than the retreat of organized religion has eliminated superstition. ([Location 1230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=1230))
- The right to issue unlimited quantities of anonymously tradable shares, along with the institution of a liquid market for them, created something new: corporations with power so immense it dwarfed that of their countries of origin and could be deployed in faraway places assiduously to exploit people and resources. ([Location 1297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=1297))
- Large quantities of apples may produce, at worst, lots of bad cider. But large amounts of money invested in liquid shares can release demonic forces that no market or state can control. ([Location 1310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=1310))
## New highlights added March 10, 2022 at 8:32 PM
- The introduction of tradable shares might have made companies limitless in theory, but it’s only with the invention of specific technologies that they have become limitless in practice: the technologies made possible by the discovery and harnessing of electromagnetism by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865. ([Location 1332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=1332))
- Hand in hand, shareholding and technology led to the creation of shareholder-owned mega-banks willing to lend to the new mega-firms by generating a new kind of mega-debt. ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=1349))
- A Soviet-like, albeit privately owned, planned system emerged, spanning the globe, allowing the captains of industry and the masters of finance, together, to shape the future for themselves and in their image. This, explained Costa, is what John Kenneth Galbraith called Technostructure, and is what, according to Kosti, the techno-syndicalists of the Other Now sought to bring down.

- Even when it is creative, Eva, capitalism is extractive. In search of shareholder profit, corporations have put these geniuses in charge of extracting the last morsel of value from humans and from the earth, from the minerals in its guts to the life in its oceans. And these brilliant minds have been used to cajole governments into accepting their raids on the planet’s resources by creating markets for them: markets for carbon dioxide and other pollutants – phoney markets controlled by their employers!
