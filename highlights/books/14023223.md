## Highlights
- ‘What does it mean to be a proletarian, really?’ Costa continued, without waiting for a reply. ‘Let me tell you. From bitter experience. It means you are a cog in a process of production that relies on what you do and think while excluding you from being anything but its product. It means the end of sovereignty, the conversion of all experiential value into exchange value, the final defeat of autonomy.’ ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=208))
- Science fiction is the archaeology of the future, a leftist philosopher once said. It is now on the verge of offering the best documentary of our present. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=226))

- ‘Capitalism and science fiction share one thing,’ he replied coolly. ‘They trade in future assets using fictitious currency. Even if these tools are still in the realm of science fiction, they are our best defence. Believe me, given half a chance the powerful will wage an all-out war against the rest of us using these high-tech weapons. We must deploy them first if we want to stand any chance of defending ourselves.’ ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=392))
- ‘My bosses understand,’ he explained, ‘that the best way to profit is first to establish a monopoly and then strategically to starve the market of the product they have monopolized.’ ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0829Q9HFY&location=411))
- With the arrival of Eva in our circle many years later, I realize now that three people had come together who had each in their different ways been lured in and then defeated by modernity: Iris by a long string of dispiriting leftist calamities, from the tragedy that befell her continental heroes Rosa Luxemburg and Aleksandra Kollontai to the triumph of Thatcher’s Britain; Eva by the weapons of mass financial destruction and ‘riskless risk’ that she herself had once peddled; Costa by his badly misplaced faith in the digital revolution’s emancipatory powers.
