## Highlights
- I’m biased, of course, and doubly so: Not only is this account about me and my crew, but we’re scientists. We live and breathe why. ([Location 49](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N2Z7B6Z&location=49))
- If I ask what I’m asking only of people who agree with me at the outset, with whom I already share a dream and a language, then there’s no point in asking at all. ([Location 56](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N2Z7B6Z&location=56))

- The picture was boring, and while the factoid that came with it was new and somewhat interesting, I was four. New and somewhat interesting applied to about ninety percent of my day, in everything from the development of a scab, to a cartoon I’d never seen, to an unexpected flavour of juice at lunch. It’s difficult to assign value to discovery when you haven’t sorted out the parameters of reality yet. ([Location 81](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N2Z7B6Z&location=81))
- Habitable exoplanets may have been lost on me then, but metamorphosis never was. It has always been a thing of beauty to me, the fluidity of form. ([Location 104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N2Z7B6Z&location=104))
- The mirror knows you’re anxious to see yourself – but take your time, it says. I’m here when you’re ready, and not a second before. It is the kindest object placement I’ve ever seen. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07N2Z7B6Z&location=146))
- Again, I’m as biased as can be, but I believe somaforming is the most ethical option when it comes to setting foot off Earth. I’m an observer, not a conqueror. I have no interest in changing other worlds to suit me. I choose the lighter touch: changing myself to suit them.
