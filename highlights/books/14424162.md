## Highlights
- He was aiming for a PhD in math, but he realized it was beyond his abilities—“I had my nose rubbed in my limitations” is how he puts it—and he dropped out. It wasn’t wasted time, however. Classes in ornithology made Bill an avid bird-watcher, and because Arizona is a great place to see birds, he did fieldwork part-time for scientists, then got a job with the Department of Agriculture and stayed for a while.

- What my research had shown was that the average expert had done little better than guessing on many of the political and economic questions I had posed. “Many” does not equal all. It was easiest to beat chance on the shortest-range questions that only required looking one year out, and accuracy fell off the further out experts tried to forecast—approaching the dart-throwing-chimpanzee level three to five years out. That was an important finding. ([Location 109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=109))
- I believe it is possible to see into the future, at least in some situations and to some extent, and that any intelligent, open-minded, and hardworking person can cultivate the requisite skills. ([Location 122](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=122))

- In one of history’s great ironies, scientists today know vastly more than their colleagues a century ago, and possess vastly more data-crunching power, but they are much less confident in the prospects for perfect predictability. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=177))
- How predictable something is depends on what we are trying to predict, how far into the future, and under what circumstances. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=223))
- Laws of physics aside, there are no universal constants, so separating the predictable from the unpredictable is difficult work. There’s no way around it. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=232))
- Big leaps in computing power and continued refinement of forecasting models may nudge the limits a little further into the future but those advances gradually get harder and the payoffs shrink toward zero. How good can it get? No one knows. But knowing the current limits is itself a success. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=239))
- That’s because the forecast-measure-revise procedure operates only within the rarefied confines of high-tech forecasting, such as the work of macroeconomists at central banks or marketing and financial professionals in big companies or opinion poll analysts like Nate Silver.7 More often forecasts are made and then … nothing. Accuracy is seldom determined after the fact and is almost never done with sufficient regularity and rigor that conclusions can be drawn. The reason? Mostly it’s a demand-side problem: The consumers of forecasting—governments, business, and the public—don’t demand evidence of accuracy. So there is no measurement. Which means no revision. And without revision, there can be no improvement. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=243))
- “I have been struck by how important measurement is to improving the human condition,” Bill Gates wrote. “You can achieve incredible progress if you set a clear goal and find a measure that will drive progress toward that goal. … This may seem basic, but it is amazing how often it is not done and how hard it is to get right.” ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=252))
- Sometimes forecasts are used to advance political agendas and galvanize action—as activists hope to do when they warn of looming horrors unless we change our ways. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=260))
- This jumble of goals is seldom acknowledged, which makes it difficult to even start working toward measurement and progress. It’s a messy situation, which doesn’t seem to be getting better. ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=264))
- For scientists, not knowing is exciting. It’s an opportunity to discover; the more that is unknown, the greater the opportunity. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=268))
- In year 1, GJP beat the official control group by 60%. In year 2, we beat the control group by 78%. GJP also beat its university-affiliated competitors, including the University of Michigan and MIT, by hefty margins, from 30% to 70%, and even outperformed professional intelligence analysts with access to classified data. After two years, GJP was doing so much better than its academic competitors that IARPA dropped the other teams.10 ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=296))
- Foresight isn’t a mysterious gift bestowed at birth. It is the product of particular ways of thinking, of gathering information, of updating beliefs. These habits of thought can be learned and cultivated by any intelligent, thoughtful, determined person. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=303))
- For centuries, it hobbled progress in medicine. When physicians finally accepted that their experience and perceptions were not reliable means of determining whether a treatment works, they turned to scientific testing—and medicine finally started to make rapid advances. The same revolution needs to happen in forecasting. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=317))
- As with the experts who had real foresight in my earlier research, what matters most is how the forecaster thinks. I’ll describe this in detail, but broadly speaking, superforecasting demands thinking that is open-minded, careful, curious, and—above all—self-critical. It also demands focus. The kind of thinking that produces superior judgment does not come effortlessly. Only the determined can deliver it reasonably consistently, which is why our analyses have consistently found commitment to self-improvement to be the strongest predictor of performance.

- Human thought is beset by psychological pitfalls, a fact that has only become widely recognized in the last decade or two. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=382))

- If patients who were identical in every way were put into two groups, and the groups were treated differently, he wrote, we would know the treatment caused any difference in outcome. It seems simple but is impossible in practice because no two people are exactly alike, not even identical twins, so the experiment will be confounded by the differences among test subjects. The solution lay in statistics: Randomly assigning people to one group or the other would mean whatever differences there are among them should balance out if enough people participated in the experiment. Then we can confidently conclude that the treatment caused any differences in observed outcomes. It isn’t perfect. There is no perfection in our messy world. But it beats wise men stroking their chins. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00Y78X7HY&location=465))
