- I’m only telling you all of this because it’s what a memoir calls for: tea leaves. Selected stories that foretell the person I would become. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=331))

- The last couple of levels before graduation at FCI were basically unpaid jobs in the school’s restaurant. In other words, I was paying them for the privilege of cooking food for customers. (Why anyone would want to go to a cooking school restaurant in the first place is beyond me.) But I was hooked. There was no romantic, come-to-Jesus moment about cooking, but I had at least found something I didn’t hate doing. I became captivated by the industry, talking my classmates’ ears off about restaurants—most of which I’d never visited.

- I was always behind, but I relished the opportunity that the kitchen offered to take another swing with each new day. In a kitchen environment (as opposed to the golf course), I found a reserve of sheer, stubborn willpower to make up for what I lacked in talent. Here in front of my cutting board, I could see slow but definitive results. It gave me purpose. ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=522))
- The reward, if you survived and showed a little verve in the process, was the privilege of working directly with Carmellini to come up with a special. You got to flex in front of your peers, but you’d need to conceive, prep, and have the special ready by the next service, while also taking care of your usual tasks. It’s a common dynamic in high-end kitchens—the better you get at your job, the harder it gets—but it was especially pronounced at Café Boulud.
