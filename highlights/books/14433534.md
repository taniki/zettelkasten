- To be young and Asian in America often means fighting a multifront war against sameness. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=304))
- I’m only telling you all of this because it’s what a memoir calls for: tea leaves. Selected stories that foretell the person I would become. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=331))

- The last couple of levels before graduation at FCI were basically unpaid jobs in the school’s restaurant. In other words, I was paying them for the privilege of cooking food for customers. (Why anyone would want to go to a cooking school restaurant in the first place is beyond me.) But I was hooked. There was no romantic, come-to-Jesus moment about cooking, but I had at least found something I didn’t hate doing. I became captivated by the industry, talking my classmates’ ears off about restaurants—most of which I’d never visited.

- I was always behind, but I relished the opportunity that the kitchen offered to take another swing with each new day. In a kitchen environment (as opposed to the golf course), I found a reserve of sheer, stubborn willpower to make up for what I lacked in talent. Here in front of my cutting board, I could see slow but definitive results. It gave me purpose. ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=522))
- The reward, if you survived and showed a little verve in the process, was the privilege of working directly with Carmellini to come up with a special. You got to flex in front of your peers, but you’d need to conceive, prep, and have the special ready by the next service, while also taking care of your usual tasks. It’s a common dynamic in high-end kitchens—the better you get at your job, the harder it gets—but it was especially pronounced at Café Boulud.

- Like so many impressionable college students, I’d been captivated by Emerson and Thoreau, who helped plant the seeds for American Pragmatism. I interpreted their writing to mean that one’s goal should be to live as an embodiment of philosophy, to test one’s beliefs through one’s actions rather than through study or discussion. Cooking was my way of making that happen. If I wasn’t cooking food I believed in, then what was I even doing? ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=726))
- I had a feeling, I told Dr. Eliot, that humans aren’t all that different as you move around the world. What worked in Asia could work here, too. Someone just needed to give it a place to breathe. ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=792))
- Thoreau said, “I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.” I took that very much to heart as I contemplated suicide. Elevation through conscious endeavor. Work toward something. Open a restaurant. If it doesn’t pan out, there’s always the other path.

- I had little reason to believe my dad would support me in this endeavor. I’d failed to land any kind of respectable postgrad job because my grades were too low, and now I wanted to chase a career in the one industry he said was unacceptable. I hyped myself up before approaching him, suppressing my dread by adopting a scorch-the-earth attitude: I’ll do this without you, Dad. This is a courtesy—your last chance to invest in me before I move on. The fact of the matter was I had nowhere else to turn. Over the phone, I blurted out the forceful-sounding material I’d rehearsed without letting him get a word in. I outlined my case, to which he replied with one word. “Okay.” ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=860))
