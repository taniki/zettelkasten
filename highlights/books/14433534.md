## Highlights
- To be young and Asian in America often means fighting a multifront war against sameness. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=304))
- I’m only telling you all of this because it’s what a memoir calls for: tea leaves. Selected stories that foretell the person I would become. ([Location 331](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=331))

- The last couple of levels before graduation at FCI were basically unpaid jobs in the school’s restaurant. In other words, I was paying them for the privilege of cooking food for customers. (Why anyone would want to go to a cooking school restaurant in the first place is beyond me.) But I was hooked. There was no romantic, come-to-Jesus moment about cooking, but I had at least found something I didn’t hate doing. I became captivated by the industry, talking my classmates’ ears off about restaurants—most of which I’d never visited. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=495))
- I was always behind, but I relished the opportunity that the kitchen offered to take another swing with each new day. In a kitchen environment (as opposed to the golf course), I found a reserve of sheer, stubborn willpower to make up for what I lacked in talent. Here in front of my cutting board, I could see slow but definitive results. It gave me purpose. ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=522))
- The reward, if you survived and showed a little verve in the process, was the privilege of working directly with Carmellini to come up with a special. You got to flex in front of your peers, but you’d need to conceive, prep, and have the special ready by the next service, while also taking care of your usual tasks. It’s a common dynamic in high-end kitchens—the better you get at your job, the harder it gets—but it was especially pronounced at Café Boulud.

- Like so many impressionable college students, I’d been captivated by Emerson and Thoreau, who helped plant the seeds for American Pragmatism. I interpreted their writing to mean that one’s goal should be to live as an embodiment of philosophy, to test one’s beliefs through one’s actions rather than through study or discussion. Cooking was my way of making that happen. If I wasn’t cooking food I believed in, then what was I even doing? ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=726))
- I had a feeling, I told Dr. Eliot, that humans aren’t all that different as you move around the world. What worked in Asia could work here, too. Someone just needed to give it a place to breathe. ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=792))
- Thoreau said, “I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.” I took that very much to heart as I contemplated suicide. Elevation through conscious endeavor. Work toward something. Open a restaurant. If it doesn’t pan out, there’s always the other path. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=797))

- I had little reason to believe my dad would support me in this endeavor. I’d failed to land any kind of respectable postgrad job because my grades were too low, and now I wanted to chase a career in the one industry he said was unacceptable. I hyped myself up before approaching him, suppressing my dread by adopting a scorch-the-earth attitude: I’ll do this without you, Dad. This is a courtesy—your last chance to invest in me before I move on. The fact of the matter was I had nowhere else to turn. Over the phone, I blurted out the forceful-sounding material I’d rehearsed without letting him get a word in. I outlined my case, to which he replied with one word. “Okay.” ([Location 860](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=860))

- Recovering alcoholics talk about needing to hit rock bottom before they are able to climb out. The paradox for the workaholic is that rock bottom is the top of whatever profession they’re in. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=947))
- NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING, SO DO WHAT YOU WANT. The way I grew up eating is more or less the same way as millions of other Asian American kids. A big part of that was hiding our food from white friends out of shame. Of course, I preferred Mom’s kimchi jjigae to pot roast or meatloaf, but I suppressed the hell out of that in order to fit in. ([Location 1027](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1027))
- As I mentioned, we learned to appropriate from our own families and cultures, too. Anything that helped us survive or gave us a competitive advantage. ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1044))
- My advice to chefs is to be transparent about your ignorance and always honor the source material. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1047))
- FORGET EVERYTHING YOU THINK AND EMBRACE WHAT YOU SEE. Quino and I also made improvements to the menu that were grounded as much in chance as in creativity. ([Location 1059](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1059))
- You simply can’t rely on common wisdom in the kitchen. Most of it is built on half-truths and outdated assumptions. Be open to every idea. ([Location 1063](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1063))
- We realized that everything can be Korean or Mexican or Japanese or Italian, and that American food can be anything. Nothing we cooked was authentic. It was neither here nor there, which made it ours. ([Location 1073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1073))
- “YOU’LL ALWAYS LOSE WHEN YOU PLAY SOMEONE ELSE’S GAME.” Speaking of Allan Benton, not only was his bacon the catalyst for many of the culinary epiphanies we had at Momofuku, he also personally bestowed me with this nugget of wisdom. ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1079))

- My belief in Momofuku had been based on two suspicions: (1) The way people ate in train stations, shopping malls, back alleys, and strip malls in Asia was superior to the way we ate in upscale New York restaurants; and (2) cooking was a job that rewarded repetition and grit more than natural talent. Now I had some proof of both. Maybe, I began to think, it was everyone else who was crazy. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1127))

- They cut into your heart and brain, and if you ask them later why they did it, they will say that it was for your own good. They were breaking you down to build you back up. Because they care about you. Because it’s how they were taught. Critical thinking, calm communication, rationality, levelheadedness: none of these traits has traditionally been valued in a kitchen. Or maybe they were, but we weren’t listening. It’s not so different from a locker room, where viciousness and anger are glamorized as part of a winning culture. ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1195))
- I grew up trying my damnedest to integrate into white society. But among the many problems with the myth of the model minority is that it erases the nuances of the Asian American experience. It also sows division, both within our community and with others. ([Location 1223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1223))
- “We don’t have titles, because if you don’t know what you’re supposed to be doing, you don’t belong here.” It’s the sort of off-brand Confucian saying that covered up my own lack of clarity. I do believe that putting too much stock in titles and org charts can stifle a company. At the same time, not everyone thrives in an environment without structure or direction or a clear chain of command. ([Location 1310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1310))
- So we started cooking again and we fixed it. I eventually paid my dad back to become fully independent, and Ssäm Bar became solvent. It’s as simple as that. I know this is a cop-out, but the Ssäm Bar turnaround story sounds more or less identical to the narrative you already read about Noodle Bar. The long and short of it is that we began serving a late-night menu of dishes we knew chefs would want to eat after work. ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1327))

- By confronting failure, you take fear out of the equation. You stop shying away from ideas just because they seem like they may not work. You start asking whether an idea is “bad” because it’s actually bad or because the common wisdom says so. You begin to thrive when you’re not supposed to. You just have to be comfortable with instability, change, and a great deal of stress. ([Location 1358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1358))
- This digital brain trust was nothing like the top-down systems you’d see at most places, where the leader usually keeps only a few trusted operatives aware of what’s truly going on. The emails allowed us to pause at the end of a crazy night and reset for the following day, equipped with new goals. The ceaseless chain of messages—if you slept in, you’d have to go through at least fifty replies—exemplified the aforementioned philosophy that there’s no idea we won’t consider. Everything is a data point we can use. TMI for most people is never enough for me. ([Location 1400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1400))

- Momofuku Ko wasn’t a stroke of great ambition or business genius. It was the only option. ([Location 1561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1561))
- More radical than opening on the pre-gentrification Lower East Side was the unapologetic, forward-thinking creativity of Wylie’s cooking. He wasn’t concerned with pleasing everyone, a form of courage almost completely absent from New York kitchens at the time. ([Location 1566](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1566))
- Tosi needed no time to begin work on our refuge for buffoons. She made herself valuable instantly, fixing a whole lot more than how we documented our pork belly storage. She built out our first office. She helped me organize English classes for staff members who couldn’t speak the language. ([Location 1591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1591))
- Tosi was a total asset for a staff made of people who were more doers than thinkers. She was also, lest I forget, one of the world’s great pastry chefs. ([Location 1597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1597))
- I was juggling two restaurants with a third on the way. The problem was, my formula for winning was based on a simple but bleak-sounding bit of logic: if everything is meaningless, then you have nothing to lose. With nothing to lose, you’re free to risk everything all the time. I attributed our success to this approach. I would triple-down on it by laying everything on the line again for Ko. ([Location 1599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1599))
- Momofuku was my identity and it was born of my depression. I couldn’t separate a failure in the kitchen, no matter how small, from a failure of the self. I’d actually come to depend on the emotional and mental instability. I wasn’t beating my illness, or even trying to, really. I had subdued it by redirecting its energy into my own productivity. We were locked together like two judo opponents. It was always there, waiting for me to loosen my grip so that it could flip me over and pin me to the ground. ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1613))
- I’d just have to sleep less. More growth, more strain, no stopping. ([Location 1618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1618))
- It fucking hurt, but I started to see the pain as no different from the feeling of soreness you get after working out. It was a good hurt. ([Location 1619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1619))
- We would strip away as much unnecessary shit as possible so we could deliver value and make a statement: we hide behind nothing here. ([Location 1650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1650))
- I often wonder aloud to my friends if I’m living in a computer simulation or cosmic reality show. It honestly sounds more logical than the unbelievable string of luck I’ve had. Perhaps my memory is editing the most hectic moments of my life so that they’re easier to digest. Or maybe I’m just a bullshitter. ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1683))
- Recently, I’ve started to see this particular incident for the lesson it was. Blame it on insecurity, depression, bipolar disorder, whatever. The simple fact is that I was contradicting my own belief that the only thing that matters is how the diners feel when they walk out the door. Because we were in such tight quarters, when you came to Momofuku, you were eating dinner with me. And nobody wants to eat dinner with a dick. ([Location 1749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1749))
- When people spend a bunch of money on something or go through a prolonged hassle to get it, they tend to do all sorts of mental gymnastics to convince themselves it was worth it. Otherwise, buyer’s remorse can sink in and you can’t brag about it to your friends. ([Location 1803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1803))
- The only benefit to tying your identity, happiness, well-being, and self-worth to your business is that you never stop thinking about it or worrying over what’s around the corner. If I have been quick to adapt to the changing restaurant landscape, it is because I have viewed it as a literal matter of survival. I have never allowed myself to coast, or believed that I deserve for life to get easier with success. That’s where hubris comes from. ([Location 1814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1814))
- This book itself is a source of near-constant uneasiness. I’m afraid that the people and restaurants and accomplishments I’ve commemorated in writing will all have disappeared by the time it’s been published. ([Location 1820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=1820))
- So do I want a third star? Absolutely. Do I want my team to feel the elation of reaching the very top of the food world? Of course I do. I also fear it. I fear the inevitable fall from the top. More than that, I fear what it means for people to think they’ve reached the pinnacle of their profession. What happens to a cook’s motivation when the job becomes about maintenance and not improvement? With a third star, you do everything you can to avoid disturbing the delicate balance you’ve created. No grind. No friction. You’re trapped by your own self-confidence, scared to abandon what you know already works.

- I thought of the other powerful people I’d encountered in my life and how I’d occasionally felt disadvantaged without the benefit of an education in business and leadership. ([Location 2642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=2642))
- “Successful people become great leaders when they learn to shift the focus from themselves to others.” ([Location 2666](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=2666))
- Eating shit meant listening. Eating shit meant acknowledging my errors and shortcomings. Eating shit meant facing confrontations that made me uncomfortable. Eating shit meant putting my cell phone away when someone was talking to me. Eating shit meant not fleeing. Eating shit meant being grateful. Eating shit meant controlling myself when people fell short of my expectations. Eating shit meant putting others before myself. ([Location 2677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=2677))

- I am a large man, so this unhinged display is scary to witness and even more terrifying to be subjected to. It’s shameful. It’s not how you treat other humans. Each meltdown feels like falling off the wagon. I’m wracked with guilt afterward, putting even more pressure on myself not to lose my temper again. Dr. Eliot would tell me there were methods to prevent the outbursts. I’ve tried them all, including stepping away from the kitchen. ([Location 2757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=2757))
- I knew that changes had to be made, and not just for the sake of pride or ambition. I needed to subvert people’s culinary expectations within the context of making prudent business decisions. Where was the intersection between making money and making trouble? ([Location 2822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=2822))

- True balance is not an average. It is two forces in equal measure. A bowl of rice is bland. A chili relish is too salty and spicy to eat alone. Eaten together, they’re perfect—a constant pull between intensity and mildness. ([Location 2984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=2984))
- I wanted the food at Momofuku to serve the same purpose as that second clip: to reveal that our beliefs may only be a matter of perspective, and that multiple things can be true at once. ([Location 3015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=3015))
- For years, I had treated the restaurant business with the same mentality that Coppola took into Apocalypse Now. He approached making a movie about the Vietnam War with the intensity of someone going to actual war. I knew how unhealthy it was. For once I hadn’t pushed hard enough, hadn’t lived like I was ready to die. And the moment I’d started trying to see the bigger picture, I’d put the business at risk. ([Location 3174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=3174))
## New highlights added April 4, 2022 at 12:55 PM
- The need for quick resolution points to a desire to get it over with, when, in fact, the only solution is to sit and marinate in how uncomfortable this all is. I have to commit the years it will take to learn about the people around me and reject my baked-in biases. I’m somewhat soothed by one thought: we are supposed to grow as people. We’re meant to ask questions, see things differently, build empathy. That’s the hope, anyway. ([Location 3260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=3260))
- CHANGE IS GUARANTEED, BUT GROWTH ISN’T. IN MY EXPERIENCE, IF YOU want to grow, you’ve got to want it. In fact, you’ve got to want it so bad that you’ll toss out everything that got you where you are. ([Location 3277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=3277))
- I’m not betting on Marge being perfect tomorrow. I want her to make mistakes. I don’t want a CEO who thinks they’ve already seen and done everything. I want someone who’s just as eager to be right as they are to be proven wrong. ([Location 3350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=3350))

- This all raises the question of whether depression is something you can control by simply sucking it up. My answer is no, I don’t think you can overcome it with willpower, but I do believe that dealing with depression is a choice that needs to be made. You have to choose to stand up every day and keep going. To reject your default settings. To offer another silly analogy, I always liken it to being a Jedi. It’s easier—and probably cooler—to give in to the dark side. The only way to be a Jedi is to do the hard thing and reject your base instincts. ([Location 3620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=3620))
- Are you hungry? Sorry—I’m not asking if you want to eat. I’m asking if you’re ready to outwork everyone else around you. Hard work is the great equalizer in the kitchen. If you can grit it out, you can overcome a significant lack of talent, experience, and privilege. ([Location 3747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=3747))
- The day you stop making mistakes is the day you stop growing. The only mistake is not to learn from your errors. ([Location 4052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=4052))
- We’ve seen the death of the chef as a celebrity figure as the cooking profession has been elevated as a whole. Getting a job as a cook is now on par with becoming a doctor or a software engineer. ([Location 4184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=4184))
- Beyond that, my only advice to you is to aim for the best and fight like hell to avoid the worst. ([Location 4189](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B083PTZQR8&location=4189))
