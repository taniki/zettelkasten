## Highlights
- Civilization – which ultimately brought about written records and more rapid dissemination of information – empowered us to seek competitive advantage by predicting our future. We needed to understand the seasons, anticipate conflict, and track relationships within a community. Cognitive capacity was still a limitation, though, as was the availability of data. These constraints were pushed to their limits. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P1TL1FS&location=216))
- I believe that our role now is to responsibly create our future. We have always had the power to change our future. This is completely different. The changes we orchestrate will be intentional, global, and focused on long-term and distant impacts that were previously impossible to understand. ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P1TL1FS&location=223))
- “Today’s future” will rely more heavily on human vision and imagination than ever before. We are injecting greater purpose and diversity into our thinking, which must reach many generations into the future. Distances between cause and effect will shrink to insignificance. We must embrace complexity. And our feelings about the future are more important than ever. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P1TL1FS&location=229))
- Many feel overwhelmed with information, freezing them into inaction. Most struggle to see the impacts of their actions on the world at large. ([Location 232](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P1TL1FS&location=232))
- Technology can be exciting, but it must come second; indeed, it can create huge distractions. ([Location 293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P1TL1FS&location=293))
- By starting with problems and desired outcomes and then working backward to actions by way of data, artificial intelligence, human expertise, complex systems analysis, economic theory, and more, we obtain a greater focus, and problems become solvable in new ways. ([Location 295](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P1TL1FS&location=295))
- Another shift in thinking is from breaking problems into small parts – called reductionism or analysis – to understanding how those parts work together – called synthesis. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P1TL1FS&location=300))

- A causal decision diagram (CDD) provides individual understanding, team alignment, and technology insertion points for decisions in complex environments. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P1TL1FS&location=403))
- My focus here is on decisions regarding actions that lead to outcomes. So “decision” here means “the decision to take some action,” not “the decision to reach some conclusion.” ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P1TL1FS&location=408))
- DI shifts our focus beyond science and systems (including AI) that “answer questions,” “provide insights,” or “make predictions” to those that help us make to decisions that guide actions, which lead to outcomes. Answers, insights, and predictions are usually necessary, but not sufficient, for connecting actions to outcomes. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P1TL1FS&location=426))
- Even if we do nothing more than drawing a CDD together, the alignment we achieve between our mental models of a situation can have tremendous value. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P1TL1FS&location=456))
- Interdependencies between departmental silos in a complex organization are often not well-understood, and so mapping them can create a lot of value. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07P1TL1FS&location=602))
