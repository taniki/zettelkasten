## Highlights
- One-Way Street,
  a quasi-constructivist collection of fragments written between
  1923–1926 and dedicated to Lacis on its publication in 1928, and the
  unfinished Arcades Project,
  begun in the late 1920s, both exhibit a modernist experimentation with
  form that can in part be attributed to Lacis' influence

- The Arcades was a vast and ambitious project, not
  simply in terms of the mass and breadth of its archival sources
  (sought out by Benjamin in the Bibliothèque Nationale in
  Paris), but also—indeed, primarily—with respect to its
  philosophical and historical intent, and the methodological and
  representational challenges it posed. Its sprawling, yet minutely
  investigated historical object was to act as the point of entry into
  the philosophically comprehended experience of metropolitan
  capitalism—not some past experience, or the experience of a past
  phase of capitalist development, but the experience of the capitalist
  metropolis in Benjamin's own day—through the construction of a
  specific series of relations between its elements ‘then’
  and ‘now’. The practice of research, conceptual
  organization and presentation that it involved was self-consciously
  conceived as a working model for a new, philosophically oriented,
  materialist historiography with political intent.

- In the ebb and flow of its changing rhythms—additions,
  revisions, reformulations and retrievals—Benjamin's Arcades
  Project provides an extraordinary case study in the labour of
  conceptual construction via the configuration and reconfiguration of
  archival materials. The voluminous ‘Notes and Materials’
  that make up the Arcades as it has come down to us remained
  unpublished until 1982, finally appearing in English only in 1999 (GS
  V; AP). Only since their publication has it been possible to get a
  clear sense of the overall trajectory of Benjamin's thought during
  this period—rendering redundant, or at least displacing, many of
  the polemics associated with previous cycles of reception. The notes
  and materials are organized into twenty-six alphabetically designated
  ‘convolutes’ (literally ‘bundles’) or folders,
  thematically defined by various objects (arcades, catacombs,
  barricades, iron constructions, mirrors, modes of
  lighting…), topics (fashion, boredom, theory of
  knowledge, theory of progress, painting,
  conspiracies…), figures (the collector, the flaneur,
  the automaton…), authors (Baudelaire, Fourier, Jung,
  Marx, Saint-Simon…) and their combinations.
