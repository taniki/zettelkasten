## Highlights
- Not only was Japan already importing about 70 percent of its foodstuffs, but the rest of the world had stopped buying rice and other Japanese agricultural products out of fear of radiation contamination. To make matters worse, it was unclear whether it would be physically possible to continue growing food in the area around Fukushima due to salt deposits from the tsunami and the possibility of radiation contamination.
- In essence, the food computer is a high tech greenhouse. It has computerized climate control systems, such as grow lights and humidifiers, and sensors to monitor oxygen levels, temperature and other climate variables. The plants in the food computer aren’t grown in soil, but are instead placed in a hydroponic or aeroponic system. In the former case, the plants’ roots are directly placed in water and in the latter, the roots are exposed to the air and misted several times a day to encourage more rapid growth.
- At the moment, only about 2 percent of the US population produces its own food and each year about 30 percent of the food produced globally is wasted due to inefficiency in supply chains.

- The food computers developed by Harper and his colleagues collect an enormous amount of data on the plants being grown—about 3.5 million data points per plant each grow cycle. The data from all the food computers on the network is then aggregated in an open database and a special machine learning algorithm filters through this data to create “climate recipes” for growing plants optimized for phenotypic traits—such as color and size—or input variables like energy or chemical use. These climate recipes can then be downloaded by other users and run as a program for a food computer, effectively “turning the everyday person into a master gardener.”
    - Note: This sounds like organic 3d printing
- One of the most promising aspects of the food computer is how it provides users with the ability to locally produce any type of crop, regardless of where they are in the world. This has a number of benefits, particularly when it comes to energy use and nutrition. With the food computer, users can see exactly how many kilowatts are used to produce a pound of plant material, a statistic that is less certain in traditional agriculture due to the complexity and opacity of supply chains.

- “The biggest problem [in agriculture] is that we became way too centralized,” said Harper. “There's been no networked advantage to agriculture yet. It's very industrial and it's still in that industrial economy mindset where efficiency is valued above all else and bigger is better. But now there’s this shifting of priorities from pure yield to better, more sustainable food. The problem is if you want sustainable agriculture, you need a lot of information and that’s just not how the food system was necessarily built.”
