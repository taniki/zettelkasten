## Highlights
- We live in “unconscious obedience to the universal grammar” of stories. In other words: We don’t tell stories, they tell us.
- Little is original in his analysis. His notion that stories tell us arose out of the structuralist anthropology of Claude Lévi-Strauss in the 1950s. Philosophers have been hard at work on story; that goes unacknowledged.
- Gottschall chooses quantity over quality, tabulating surveys about novels rather than reading them himself.
