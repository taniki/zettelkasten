## Highlights
- Workaholics are addicted to the solace they find in extreme fatigue; it’s like the high that a marathon runner might get in her last mile. I can be utterly depleted yet energized by that depletion. There’s a masochistic pride to overworking.
- A model-minority label is already a kind of erasure, because it discounts individuality. The rare times I met my father’s superiors, they were full of praise for his work ethic and his reliability, and I could see that my father was proud of their validation. But I doubt they knew very much about him, about his gardening interests or home-improvement projects or his profound love of oatmeal.
- The trick to balancing five jobs is to never, ever procrastinate. What you can do right now, you have to do now.
