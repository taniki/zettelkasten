## Highlights
- backdoor calculation of prevalence
- We saw that in New York City in the early days when we were looking at their test positivity, where it was close to 50 percent. Now, at that point, it wasn’t that 50 percent of the population was infected, it was just that you had to be really darn sick in order to get a test in New York City.
- But you shouldn’t in any way tie high-consequence decisions to any particular metric, particularly if you don’t acknowledge its flaws. And one of the things that we saw was that states like New York were using positivity metrics from different states as the basis for putting states on interstate quarantine lists. If we had standardized data for all 50 states, and if we were consistently testing approximately the same populations, that would be telling us something different, but that’s not what we have right now.
