## Highlights
- A system enjoys “network effects” if it increases in value as it adds users. Social networks are all about these effects: you join Facebook because your friends are there, and once you join, others sign up because you are there.
  But there’s a hard corollary: systems driven by network effects lose value when users leave. Your blender doesn’t get better when someone else gets a blender of their own, but it also doesn’t get worse when someone else throws theirs away.
- It describes how, over time, the coziness and connection of a friend-list populated by people you genuinely like becomes an exhausting morass of people you don’t really like, but can’t kick off the list, and how you are almost certainly oblivious to the fact that you’re someone else’s exhausting not-really-a-friend.
- Facebook owes its longevity in part to its anticompetitive conduct. By 2012, young users were fleeing Facebook, which was being colonized by their parents and teachers. They flocked to Instagram, so Facebook just bought Instagram, ensuring that its disgruntled users could not escape its grasp.
- A “switching cost” is the value of everything you give up when you switch out a product or service for a rival.
- In other words, network effects are how companies like Facebook get big, but high switching costs are how they stay big.
- At a certain point, the number of truly awful people in your Facebook feed made leaving worth the price. Growth slowed. Halted. Reversed. Last quarter, Facebook lost US daily users for the first time. Investors pounded the company, wiping more than $230m off its market cap, the largest single drop in value ever experienced by any company, ever.
- Those investors understood that when the toxic creeps push the most delicate normies off of Facebook, that leaves the rest of the nontoxic users mired in forums where the creep:normie ratio is worse. More normies leave. The ratio declines some more. Soon, it’s just a cesspool. We’ve all experienced online communities where this happened.
- Switching costs or no, people are leaving. And the nature of network effects is that every person who leaves makes Facebook less valuable to the people who stay behind. What’s more, as the bad drive out the good, the people who make Facebook most worth staying for are the ones leaving.
