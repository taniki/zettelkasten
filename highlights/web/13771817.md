## Highlights
- Relative to an interactive on its own (like PhET), narrated explorables add the emotional resonance of an invested speaker, plus challenge prompts which guide the learner’s experience.
- The applet mental model for narrated explorables suggests that you’ve loaded up some interactive representation of some concept—say, a circuit simulator.
- The applet model particularly makes sense if the important piece is the interactive representation—if it’s an authentically useful tool going forward, and the narration’s really just there to set up the initial experience.
- We see this mental model play out most directly through the literal video playback controls. It also means that when Grant asks you to do something with the interactive, the narrative track doesn’t wait for you.
- I think this mental model makes great sense when most learners will passively consume most of the experience as if it were a video. It creates a smooth ramp for those with additional curiosity to satisfy it at any moment, but perhaps when most people interact, it’ll be to jump back 10 seconds to hear a piece of the explanation again—not to manipulate the interactive themselves.
- In video games, players often share the world with virtual characters, and those characters often speak aloud while manipulating the interactive game environment you share. Game narratives don’t have a playback scrubber; instead, they might have a replay/skip button and a chapter list.
- They might highlight elements in the environment which would help you complete that challenge; if you continued to struggle, they might offer extra advice.
- Microworlds, as originally described by Papert, are meant to be simple, useful, and general sandboxes for discovering ideas in a particular domain, designed with points of entry accessible to new learners.
