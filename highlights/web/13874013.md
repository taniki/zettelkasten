## Highlights
- reach out to the maintainers and offer them generous speaking fees for remote talks to your engineering team.
- One-off paid speaking opportunities are much more likely to fit into a regular company’s model of how money should spent that monthly donations.
- Find a member of your team with speaking experience. Gather questions from your other engineers in advance, and share them with your guest so that they can prepare. Then run the session as a Q&A.
- Remember, the key problem we’re trying to solve here is how to financially support projects and maintainers that may not be very good at asking for the money.
