## Highlights
- I feel a major difference between the R culture and Python culture is that Python users seem to create code more often, whereas R users often use code. There seems to be a strong atmosphere of software engineering in the Python world: in the beginning was the custom class (with methods). For R users, in the beginning was the data.
- My main point is that if you use notebooks for software engineering, you are probably using the wrong tool, no matter how popular it is.
- Joel insists that even if you are only experimenting or prototyping, you should follow good software engineering rules (slides #46-49). I tend to disagree, because prototyping is prototyping, and engineering is engineering. Good software engineering is important, but I don’t think it is necessary to write unit tests or factor out code at the prototyping stage.
- Analyzing data and developing software are different in several aspects. The latter is meant to create generally useful and reusable products, but the former is often not generalizable—you only analyze a specific dataset, you want to draw conclusions from the specific data, and you may not be interested in or have the time to make your code reusable by other people (or it may not be possible). When the analysis is done, it is done (pretty much).

- On the other hand, data analysts often do tests in an informal way, too. As they explore the data, they may draw plots or create summary tables, in which they may be able to discover problems (e.g., wrong categories, outliers, and so on). Notebooks are great for these inline output elements, from which you can make quick discoveries.
- I haven’t met a single software engineer who loves Excel. Everyone hates it and makes fun of it, but why do so many users still use it? Again, Excel makes things tangible. You can touch the data (although it is usually a very bad idea), and draw graphics in a sheet that contains the source data (bad idea again). It makes you feel everything is well under your control: oh here is my data, and here is a graph next to it; oh I should use that column to draw the graph instead, so let me change it and I can see the updated graph immediately.2 You can do everything in a single place, and the short distance between the source (data) and the output is ace.
- Spreadsheets are often hopeless here—you cannot easily restart your brain and redo exactly the same things.
- Using an authoring language makes the narratives easier to read. By comparison, code comments are always boring plain text with no structure or rich-text elements. Literate programming is more suitable in the data analysis culture.
- I tend to agree with the person (whose name was blacked out on slide #46) that data science is not about creating software.
- These problems are very common outside the notebook world, too. As you gain more experience in software engineering, you will surely know that hard-coded paths and parameters are very bad, and you shall comment your code, but these things really take time to learn. The mindset of writing code that can be easily used by others is even harder to obtain. Practically, the authors may not just have the time and only want to get things done for themselves.
- If you know how to minimize an example, you can probably completely get rid of the notebook and provide pure code when asking questions (unless your problem is actually caused by the notebook itself). Debugging code in a notebook is certainly less pleasant than debugging pure code.
- Literate programming is a programming technique. It does not simply mean mixing code and text in a linear order.
- just let users do whatever they want in the notebook, but alert them loudly that they shall not fully trust the results until they restart the session and recompile the whole notebook in the linear order.
- Likewise, software engineering rules are certainly good, but I feel we will be overdoing the good idea if we force data analysts to follow these rules. For example, for a data analyst who doesn’t write a single function but only uses functions in an existing package to analyze the data, how should she write unit tests? What should she test? Different people have different priorities and constraints.
- Jupyter notebooks are notebooks. Jupyter is the product. R Markdown notebooks are just plain text R Markdown documents. The “notebook” is only a special execution mode of R Markdown documents (as we mentioned in the book “R Markdown: The Definitive Guide”). Or you may treat it as a by-product instead of a product. If you like it, use it; if you don’t, use the original R Markdown mode, i.e., the batch mode—click the Knit button to compile the whole document in a new R session every time. We don’t lock you in the notebook (you can check out anytime and you can always leave).
- Overall I guess Joel’s life would be a little easier if he were an R user. Well, actually R Markdown does support Python through the reticulate package. In my (biased, of course) opinion, the support is reasonably good, although I guess the RStudio IDE is unlikely to satisfy hardcore Python users looking for features like autosuggest based on the static analysis of type annotations (slide #65). Besides, if you are interested in writing books, you can check out the bookdown package, which is an R Markdown extension. Your life as a book author could be even easier.
- Can notebooks be used to write a well-structured, thoughtful, and reproducible (data analysis) report? I believe they surely can. Nothing stops you from extracting the useful parts from the scratch pads to write a formal document.
- In short, chances are your first notebook will/should not be your final product (e.g., a customer report).
- Although I’m a statistics PhD, I didn’t read many papers during my training, but I did read “Statistical Analyses and Reproducible Research” by .
- My overall conclusion is that R Markdown has a relatively solid base and enough deep roots in literate programming to defend itself.
- If you do both software engineering and data analysis heavily in a project, consider using an IDE to develop an R package, instead of stuffing your poor notebooks with thousands of lines of code.
- If you want the notebook feel but absolutely hate the possible out-of-order execution, you may try xaringan::inf_mr() (or equivalently, the RStudio Addin “Infinite Moon Reader”) on your R Markdown document.

- You can actually forget about those wars in technologies,9 if you still have the ability to focus on reading one thing for even an hour. That ability is much more important and precious than technology.
