## Highlights
- Dugin, whose voluminous works are an eccentric blend of geopolitical strategy, mystical musings on civilizational essences, and hardcore authoritarian Russian nationalism, did have influence among the Russian military and Russian policymakers in the first part of the decade, but there’s never been great evidence of a direct connection between him and Putin, and in 2014 he actually lost his job as a professor for adopting too hard a line toward Crimea. That suggests he did not have many friends in high places.
- At the heart of Dugin’s work, the goal of which is the reconstitution of the Russian empire, is a notion of Russian culture and Russian identity as, in some important respects, fundamentally different from modern European identity.
- Whether Putin has read these sentences, it’s clear that he and Dugin are at this point drawing from a similar well, invoking deep-rooted ideas of Russian identity, and scorning Ukrainian nationalism. And in that light, Dugin’s argument that Ukraine as a state has no “geopolitical meaning,” no distinctive identity, is especially striking, presaging as it does Putin’s insistence that Ukraine is in some profound sense illegitimate because it was created out of whole cloth by the U.S.S.R. A state that has no geopolitical meaning and no identity is, after all, a state that it’s easy to convince yourself it’s all right to invade.
- In the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, it’s almost as if Putin has decided to become what Dugin was urging him to be all along.
