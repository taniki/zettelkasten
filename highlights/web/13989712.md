## Highlights
- The blister that burst has been developing around the world for more than a decade. The disdain for rules at home or abroad. The lack of checks and balances. The blurring of lines between democratic opinions and extremism. The silent violence of political repression.
- Delusion is not ignorance.
- Nowhere was this lack of realism more visible than in Germany. With our left hand we philanthropically funded conflict-prevention and human rights work, learning from our history. With our right hand, we allowed business to feed a dictator's war machine. And the right hand was a lot more generous than the left.
- Most German decision-makers, and the broader public, preferred not to notice. Thinking that smart diplomacy had frozen the Donbass conflict and now one could get back to business.
- We want Europe to be based on rules, conflicts to be resolved in negotiations, and borders to be left in place. That is the European order.
- The European order also has a strong internal dimension. It is built on democracy and the rule of law.
- The opposite of realism is not idealism. The opposite of realism is not seeing the world as it is.
