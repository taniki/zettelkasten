## Highlights
- I don't really love the term "Tools for Thought," either, since it's so broad. Offloading mental work onto external tools is something that humans have been doing for many thousands of years. If my notetaking app is a tool for thought or an auxiliary brain, then so is an abacus, and so is a Mesopotamian stele containing tax codes that people might otherwise struggle to retain.
