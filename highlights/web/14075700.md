## Highlights
- As a statistician, I appreciate the quote by applied statistics pioneer W. Edwards Deming, “In God we trust. All others bring data.” But as a social scientist, I’m compelled to warn you that many decision-makers chase data with too much zeal, running from ignorance but never improving their decisions. Is there a way to land in the sweet spot? There is, and it starts with one simple decision-making habit: Commit to your default decision up front.
- The key to decision-making is framing the decision context before you seek data — a skill that unfortunately is not usually covered in data science courses.
- Many decision-makers think they’re being data-driven when they look at a number, form an opinion, and execute their decision. Unfortunately, such a decision will be “data-inspired” at best.
- If you’re undisciplined in your attempts to use data for decision-making, your approach is susceptive to cognitive bias.
- One major problem with data-inspired decision-making is confirmation bias, which influences how the decision-maker will perceive facts in light of what they already believe.
- That’s why behavioral economists are trained to set decision criteria in advance of information. Since it’s the best antidote to confirmation bias, many of us have it ingrained as a habit. We can’t help but ask ourselves, for example, the maximum amount that we’d pay for a ticket before we look up the price.
- Another human foible to avoid is the Ikea effect. You’re experiencing this effect if you overvalue something as a result of having put effort into it.  Simply put, when people invest time into a project, they’re likely to fall in love with it, even if what they’ve built is a pile of poisonous rubbish, and this will change how they perceive it. They’ll start bargaining with themselves, “Oh, but the performance of my new prototype is not so bad, I could still release this thing…” And that’s how horrible things get foisted upon the world.
- To avoid falling victim to these effects — to be truly data-driven — order matters! You need to frame the decision context up front. And the first part of that process is determining what you’re planning to do in the absence of further data. (Will you buy/launch/medicate/proceed or not buy/launch/medicate/proceed by default?). That’s called a default action and you’ll choose it by making a judgment call about which action is the lesser evil under ignorance.
- Choosing a default action is difficult for decision-makers who aren’t used to it. You ask yourself, “If I see no additional data beyond what I’ve already seen, what will I do?” Answering this takes strength of character  —  you can’t punt it to the data. You really have to think about the business problem and answer truthfully, “What am I going to pick if I have to make the decision right now?”
- Once you’ve specified your default action, you’re cleared to start thinking about data. But even then, the first step isn’t to go collect or analyze it. After deciding what your default action will be in the absence of new information, you’re going to think about how you would react to the data when it arrives. What form should it take to talk you out of your default action? To answer this question, you need the ability to imagine various states of the world, identify whether the default is the right action for each of them, and then create a metric that can tell you which of these worlds you inhabit. Finally, you’ll consider what magnitude of evidence is required to sway you from the default and what your tolerance for risk is. Only then is it time to get into the numbers.
