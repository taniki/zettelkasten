## Highlights
- For example, statisticians might forget the equations for a t-test’s p-value because they get it by hitting run on a software package, but they never forget how and when to use one, as well as the correct philosophical interpretation of the results. Analysts, on the other hand, aren’t looking to interpret. They’re after a view into the shape of a gory, huge, multidimensional dataset. By knowing the way the equation for the p-value slices their dataset, they can form a reverse view of what the patterns in original dataset must have been to produce the number they saw. Without an appreciation of the math, you don’t get that view. Unlike a statistician, though, they don’t care if the t-test is right for the data. They care that the t-test gives them a useful view of what’s going on in the current dataset. The distinction is subtle, but it’s important. Statisticians deal with things outside the data, while analysts stick to things inside it. At peak excellence, both are deeply mathematical and they often use the same equations, but their jobs are entirely different.
