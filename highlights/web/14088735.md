## Highlights
- Good analysts have unwavering respect for the one golden rule of their profession: do not come to conclusions beyond the data (and prevent your audience from doing it, too).
- They also discourage leaders’ overconfidence by emphasizing a multitude of possible interpretations for every insight.
- While statistical skills are required to test hypotheses, analysts are your best bet for coming up with those hypotheses in the first place.
- As analysts mature, they’ll begin to get the hang of judging what’s important in addition to what’s interesting, allowing decision-makers to step away from the middleman role.
- Because subject matter expertise goes a long way towards helping you spot interesting patterns in your data faster, the best analysts are serious about familiarizing themselves with the domain.
