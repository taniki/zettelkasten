## Highlights
- In addition to all that, this article suggests you look for analysts with three more traits:They’re aware that the mind finds meaning where it doesn’t exist, so they stay humble and avoid jumping to conclusions.They don’t try to sell you a story found by torturing data until it confesses. Instead, they use hedging/softening language when talking about data.They have the discipline to come up with multiple interpretations for everything. The faster they produce multiple explanations and the more alternatives they generate, the more the force is them. Try interviewing for this skill next time you’re hiring an analytics Jedi.
