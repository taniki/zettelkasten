## Highlights
- Among their goals is fixing an age-old problem with Twitter: the fact that most people come to the service and don’t post. Anita Butler, head of consumer design, puts it bluntly: “We don’t have trouble getting people to sign up for Twitter. What we have trouble with is retaining those customers.”
- Twitter’s new product chiefs indicated that there hasn’t necessarily been a shift in strategy under Agrawal, but there has been a shift in how things get done. “Under Parag’s leadership, and he was very direct about this, our purpose and our mission as the conversation layer [of the internet] hasn’t changed,” says Sullivan, who now leads the consumer product teams under Beykpour.
- Instead, Agrawal’s influence is being felt in how products are developed, according to Weber, Twitter’s new leader of consumer engineering. “We are becoming more and more data-driven,” he says. “I think Parag brings a cultural change where basically we are pragmatic. We look at metrics, we do experiments, we increase the size of the experiments, et cetera.”
- Given Jack Dorsey’s obsession with Bitcoin, Twitter’s interest in crypto wasn’t a surprise. But even now that he has left to focus on Block, Twitter is continuing to experiment with crypto features and invest in Bluesky, an ambitious project that aims to change Twitter from a centralized company to something like an email app running atop an open protocol others can build on.
- On a more immediate timeline, crypto still factors into the ways Twitter is thinking about allowing users to incentive creators.
