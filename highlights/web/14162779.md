## Highlights
- I’ve always been good at accumulating knowledge. I can sit for hours reading and writing and I find it refreshing. Up until I became a manager, I could study my way out of most of my problems. It was like that at school and university. It was like that as I’ve started to solve business problems within a company. There were exceptions, of course. Relationship with a significant other is a noteworthy one, but let’s not get into that. The point is, as an IC, there is usually a clear path to solving a problem: lots of careful study, followed by an ideally simple implementation.
  That doesn’t work with management. At first I thought it would, so I took the Personal MBA Book list, by Josh Kaufman, plus some other recommendations, and I started reading them like mad. At one point, I was consuming more than one book per week (Audible at 1.5x speed was a big help here). Yet, I was surprised to find how little they helped.
- With that in mind, I started to look for signs if management was for me. The first one was a tremendous impostor syndrome. That is probably normal in the first months or even in the first year (something that I figured out by talking to other newly crowned managers). But it should diminish with time. Mine didn’t. I learned to live with it, but that’s not something you want for the long run. I don’t know exactly what caused it, but my best guess was that I simply couldn’t see management as work (more on that later). From not feeling productive to feeling like a fraud is one quick step (assuming you have some work ethics, that is).
- You have to sacrifice understanding the nuances of a project so that you can give attention to the myriad of projects your team is delivering. In order to see the big picture, you lose your ability to appreciate the complexity in each portion of it. That sucked the life out of me.
- It was more like my identity didn’t match with what I was becoming.
- If your personality doesn’t match with one that can quickly switch from one context to the next, that is good at influencing others and forming powerful relationships, that has meetings as its natural habitat and that’s terrific at handling uncertainty, management will certainly come with it’s pains.
- As I transition back to IC, my plan is to be very intentional on covering those knowledge gaps. Fortunately for me, applying Data Science to business is both fascinating and difficult, so I don’t think there will be a shortage of learning opportunities anytime soon.
- What excited me about management was the people part of the job. I loved to see others develop personally and professionally and it was an honor to work as a catalyst for that process. As I transition back to an IC, I’m happy to find out that I don’t need to let that go. True, I won’t be responsible for people’s careers. But mentoring will still be a huge (if not the majority) of my responsibility as an IC.
- Senior ICs should solve complex and valuable problems. But they should also get excited by well executed “normal” daily activities, like model monitoring, data pre-processing and query optimization.
