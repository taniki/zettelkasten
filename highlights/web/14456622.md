## Highlights
- If we are to make good decisions, we must understand the consequences of our choices. This applies to individuals as well as public policy makers: young people who are making educational choices want to know how these affect their future income; politicians considering a range of reforms want to know how these affect employment and income distribution, for example. However, answering broad questions about cause and effect is not easy, because we will never know what would have happened if we had made a different choice.
- Despite these challenges, the Laureates have demonstrated that many of society’s big questions can be answered. Their solution is to use natural experiments – situations arising in real life that resemble randomised experiments. These natural experiments may be due to natural random variations, institutional rules or policy changes.
- Overall, we now have a considerably better understanding of how the labour market operates than we did 30 years ago.
- In a natural experiment, the researcher also has access to data from treatment and control groups but, unlike a clinical trial, the individuals may themselves have chosen whether they want to participate in the intervention being offered.
- The framework they created has radically changed how researchers approach empirical questions using data from natural experiments or randomised field experiments.
- One question that is relevant to both society and to young people considering their future, is how much more you would earn if you chose to study longer. An initial attempt to answer this question could involve looking at data on how people’s earnings relate to their education. In every conceivable context, people with more years of education have higher incomes.
- The data show that people with higher incomes live longer – but is this really due to their higher incomes, or do these people have other attributes that mean they both live longer and earn more? It is easy to think of more examples where there is reason to question whether correlation actually implies a true causal relationship.
- When Angrist and Krueger compared people born in the first and fourth quarters of the year, they saw that the first group had, on average, spent less time in education. People born in the first quarter also had lower incomes than those born in the fourth quarter. As adults they thus had both less education and lower incomes than those born late in the year.
- Research conducted over the past 30 years has shown that this is not the case: natural experiments occur frequently. For example, they may arise due to policy changes in some regions of a country, admission cut-offs in higher education, or income thresholds in tax and benefit systems, which mean that some individuals are exposed to an intervention while other, similar, individuals are not. There is thus unintended randomness that divides people into control and treatment groups, providing researchers with opportunities for uncovering causal relationships.
- Card and Krueger focused on employment in fast-food restaurants, an industry where pay is low and minimum wages matter. Contrary to previous research, they found that an increase in the minimum wage had no effect on the number of employees. David Card arrived at the same conclusion in a couple of studies in the early 1990s. This pioneering research has led to a large number of follow-up studies. The overall conclusion is that the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage are small, and significantly smaller than was believed 30 years ago.

- For example, follow-up studies have shown that increased immigration has a positive effect on income for many groups who were born in the country, while people who immigrated at an earlier time are negatively affected.
- To examine whether school resources have an impact on students’ future labour market success, David Card and Alan Krueger compared the returns on education for people who lived in the same state in the US, but who had grown up in different states – for example, people who had grown up in Alabama or Iowa, but now lived in California. The idea is that people who have moved to California and have the same level of education are comparable. If the returns on education differ, this is probably due to Alabama and Iowa having invested differently in their education systems. Card and Krueger found that resources are important: returns on education increased with teacher density in the state in which the individuals had grown up.
- There is now relatively strong empirical support to show that investments in education influence students’ later success on the labour market. This effect is particularly strong for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
- Under which conditions can we use a natural experiment to estimate the effects of a particular intervention, such as a computing course, when the effects vary between individuals and we do not have complete control of who participates? How can we estimate this effect and how should it be interpreted?
- One important conclusion is that it is only possible to estimate the effect among the people who changed their behaviour as a result of the natural experiment. This implies that Angrist and Krueger’s conclusion about the effect on income of an additional year of education – which they estimated to be nine per cent – only applies to those people who actually chose to leave school when given the chance.
- It is not possible to determine which individuals are included in this group, but we can determine its size. The effect for this group has been named the local average treatment effect, LATE.
- Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens thus showed exactly what conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments. Their analysis is also relevant for randomised experiments where we do not have complete control over who participates in the intervention, which is the case in almost all field experiments. The framework developed by Angrist and Imbens has been widely adopted by researchers who work with observational data. By clarifying the assumptions necessary to establish a causal relationship, their framework has also increased the transparency – and thus credibility – of empirical research.
