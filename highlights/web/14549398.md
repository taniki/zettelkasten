## Highlights
- With activist investors still circling, and incoming CEO Parag Agrawal confronted with few obvious levers to quickly boost revenue growth, it seemed likely that the company was about to have a tumultuous year.
- The first few months of this year have been relatively quiet at Twitter, at least from the standpoint of corporate governance. But that all changed on Monday, when it was revealed that Twitter’s largest individual shareholder is now Elon Musk.
- One element of Meta’s strategy was to pump hot air into extremely thin stories, such as a widely covered but apparently false idea that a viral “challenge” on TikTok was leading students around the country to slap their teachers. In reality, according to Insider, the challenge was a rumor that had started on Facebook. But that didn’t stop Targeted Victory from promoting stories about it anyway, along with coverage of a previous vandalism challenge known as “devious licks” that, while rooted in fact, also began as a rumor on Facebook.
- It’s in keeping with Musk’s online persona, which I would describe as “mischievous trickster god,” that he had acquired his stake in Twitter almost two weeks before tweeting about its approach to free expression and whether an alternative network might be needed.
- These facts raise the interesting possibility that Musk uses his new position to pressure Twitter into taking a more hands-off approach to content moderation, only to ultimately learn that doing so is bad for the value of his investment. Dorsey left Twitter in large part because he could not figure out how to get it to grow, either in users or revenue; I imagine it won’t grow much faster just because (for example) the company decides to let people go nuts sharing vaccine misinformation.
- It’s also worth asking that, to the extent any students did eventually begin vandalizing their schools for content-creation reasons, they had been inspired by the very coverage Meta was busy promoting in local newspapers and TV stations around the country. Even the fact that Meta might have helped to inspired such copycats ought to have been enough to kill this project when it was still being white-boarded.
- He bought 9.2% of Twitter because he has money, and wants to spend some of it on being more annoying on Twitter.
- From the perspective of basic company self-interest, it’s hard to imagine a worse time to draw further attention to the risks social apps pose to children. Regulators and lawmakers paint with a broad brush, and any step they might be inclined to take to punish TikTok would almost certainly splash back on Facebook and Instagram as well.
- There’s the cynicism of planting op-eds and letters to the editor in local newspapers, with their internet-decimated staffs and diminished investigative powers, knowing they need the content and likely won’t ask too many questions about where it came from.
- In any case, I wouldn’t totally discount the idea that Musk has some concrete ideas for Twitter. He has asked his followers to weigh in on whether Twitter’s ranking algorithms should be open-sourced, which could build trust by letting anyone inspect them. An open-sourced Twitter also would seem to fit in with the idea of turning the core service into a decentralized protocol, a pet project for both Dorsey and Agrawal.
- Ballmer’s investment looked like a bet on Twitter’s business fundamentals. Musk’s looks more like if Loki bought an ant farm.
- By now Facebook should know that it all comes out eventually. And when it does, whatever incremental gains it made by slagging its enemies will be swallowed up by the reputational damage that comes from indulging the devil on your shoulder.In 2018, Mark Zuckerberg said he didn’t want to run his company that way. But in the end he did, and I imagine Meta will suffer for it.
